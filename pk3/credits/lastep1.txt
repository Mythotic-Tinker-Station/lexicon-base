                      Story



  Three years ago today you were the marine stationed on a small earth base when a transmission warning of the imminent total 
invasion of the planet was received. The planet is still being rebuilt little by little, and the faint traces of demonic presence are being 
removed as effectively as an entire planet's population can. 
  The UAC conglomerate, responsible for the first experiment gone horribly wrong has been dismantled, leaving only a few small labs 
and abandoned towers. 
  This horrible anniversary only reminds you of what you wish you could forget. You try not to think about it, instead concentrating on 
your intercom. A staticy message penetrates. You solidify the signal to try to get some sort of meaning out of it. 
  " . . immediate military support. They did it again! Help us!" 
  Garbled, unintelligable, and yet painfully clear. Again, the not quite dead UAC experimented with gateways, and again, hell is on 
earth. 
  In a matter of time, you're the one sent down to cut off their entry point to the rest of the planet. You know you can't do it alone, but 
as your superiors explain to you, it's the only option. 
  You need to keep them at bay for twenty-four hours before a full air-strike on the area can kill all the hellspawn. And you, with it. 
  This is your last day on earth.
