Background              : The plan was to try and make a megawad for Doom2
                          that would look alright and be fun to play.
                          Hopefully this has been acheived.

                          The goals were:

                          1. Make something that would follow a similar
                             story to the original Doom / Doom 2 / Doom 3.
                          2. Skill level: Not too hard, to be more fun than
                             a challenge.
                          3. Make all maps playable from a pistol start.
                          4. Make all maps completable in under 10 minutes
                             UV Max 100% Secrets.
                          5. Should work with all source ports and original
                             Doom.
                          6. Try to maintain continuity between maps.
                          
                          Notes:
                          There is no high detail due to limitations but
                          I've tried to make most areas aesthetically
                          pleasing while trying to avoid inducing HOMs or
                          VPOs.
                          Most of the maps are pretty linear, some of the
                          later maps are more non-linear.
                          Maps 17, 20, 25, 29, 32 break rule 4.
                          MAP30 may be of particular interest to nightmare
                          speed runners.
                          Please make sure you play MAP32 all the way to
                          the end (100% Secrets), try not to give up or
                          cheat.
                          A couple of maps MAP09 and MAP18 have slightly
                          different gameplay than normal.
                          The skill level on UV is hopefully comparable to
                          original Doom 2, if you found it too easy and
                          want more of a challenge try to get UV MAX under
                          par from pistol start.

                          All maps are playable using the original Doom 2
                          v1.9.
                          I recommend using a source port mainly due to the
                          increased graphic / sound quality but also
                          because it is possible to encounter visplane
                          overflows and hall of mirrors on some maps
                          (specific areas are detailed below).
                          All maps are designed with gl based ports in
                          mind, so none of the maps have special effects
                          (i.e. deep water, bridges) that may cause
                          problems with these.

                          There are 12 deathmatch starts on all maps except
                          MAP30 and MAP31 which have 4.
                          It seems to play OK as long as you have 12
                          players (4 on 30 and 31).
                          You can play in co-op mode but this was untested.
                          Co-op mode has the extra weapons intended for
                          deathmatch.

                          The included demos work with Doom2 v1.9 and
                          Chocolate Doom.

                          This wad is dedicated to absent friends and to
                          anyone who bothers to take the time to do this
                          type of thing (especially those listed below but
                          not just wads and source ports for Doom any
                          contribution).

Testing                 : Doom 2 Reloaded has been tested with the
                          following versions / source ports:
                          Doom2 v1.9, Chocolate Doom, Skulltag, ZDoom,
                          GZDoom, Doomsday Engine, Vavoom, Edge, Risen3D,

                          Eternity Engine.
                          There are a couple of problems in a couple of
                          ports. Most can be worked around using the 
                          no clip cheat (see below for details).

                          stationed on mars. It's your job to retire
                          replicants that don't want to help with the
                          terraforming project.
                          Everything has been fine until recently.
                          Contact has been lost with a remote water
                          processing faclility.
                          The UAC want you to investigate...
                          There has been a lot of top secret activity
                          recently, you wonder if the incident may be
                          related.

Description             : Contact has been lost with a remote water

                          a nearby outpost. Unusually UAC have requested
                          that you investigate. Possibly this is due to
                          your high security clearance...

                          need a key card to gain entry. The east side of
                          the facility is also locked. It may be possible
                          to find an alternative entrance via the waste

                          able to find a key card in one of the offices.
                          You vaguely recollect a nasty accident occurred

                          main UAC base. Hopefully there may be someone

                          strangely familiar place, possibly another

                          processing facility which isn't too far from
                          where you wanted to be anyway. Get to the surface

                          A terminal informs you that another invasion is
                          imminent but you can subvert the portal to the
                          crusher. Alas the reactor has been flooded so you
                          will have to drain it in order to restore power.

                          range hyper-transport were true. If it exists you
                          may be able to use it to return directly to

                          on the opposite side of the city. Head through

Gameplay Tips           : In total there are 170 secrets littered
                          throughout the 32 maps. (Approx 5 per map, 32
                          on MAP32). Please try to find them all as they
                          will aid your journey greatly.
                          They all have some clue as to where they are you
                          just need to be observant or make an educated
                          guess.

                          If you are stuck on the following maps these tips
                          may be of some help:

MAP09                   : You only have a short time until the invasion
                          starts. The easier the skill level the more time
                          you have. Drain the reactor and redirect the
                          portal to the crusher as fast as possible. Close
                          the doors surrounding the crusher for the best
                          results. If you use original Doom2 on UV you may
                          have a hard time as there are some arch viles.

MAP18                   : Don't shoot anything until you have activated the
                          security grid. There are a couple of clues left
                          around that will guide you. There are a couple of
                          areas that you can make safe if you really want
                          to take out something that's been chasing you,
                          but it may be easier just to lock them out and
                          take them out later. There is always some way to
                          avoid the demons, you just need to figure it out.
                          It should be safe to shoot about 10 seconds after
                          activating the security grid.

MAP32                   : You will need your wits about you to complete
                          this level with 100% secrets. One of the earlier
                          secrets is on a time delay, make sure you get to
                          it within 30 seconds.
                          If you can't make the time delay door have a
                          think because there is another way to do it that
                          requires less effort though it could take a bit
                          longer if you were concerned about the time.

Specific Problems       : When played with the original Doom 2 v1.9 the
                          following problems can occur:

                          MAP01 - The health potions at the 2nd secret can
                                  jump into the air if the secret is
                                  activated before they are picked up, this
                                  is due to the way Doom moves things.
                          MAP03 - Be careful When looking in from yellow
                                  door area as you can get a Visplane
                                  overflow .
                          MAP07 - It is possible to get trapped (no exit)
                                  if you keep killing resurrected demons.
                                  You can get a visplane overflow when
                                  the whole level is open and looking in
                                  from the outside area.
                          MAP11 - In the warehouse you can get a hall of
                                  mirrors when stand by the big closed
                                  doors and look inward.
                          MAP20 - There may a couple of barely noticeable
                                  Halls of Mirrors at various points.
                          MAP22 - At start area when up on the right (you
                                  get there later on) it is possible to get
                                  a visplane overflow when looking towards
                                  the shotgun.
                          MAP26 - When entering the super shotgun area just
                                  before the red key you can get a visplane
                                  overflow if you are looking straight
                                  ahead.

                                 yellow key.
                           This port draws some transparent textures
                           incorrectly. This causes problems because
                           transparent textures are used quite a lot for
                           barriers etc. Sometimes the barriers aren't
                           visible at all which will cause a lot of
                           confusion for the player.
                           Draws some lower textures incorrectly (if you
                           have a lift which has a window at the bottom,
                           the lower texture alignment sometimes looks
                           wrong).
                           Enemies can see you when they shouldn't i.e. if
                           you are on the top of a lift and they are at the
                           bottom or vice versa and there is no line of
                           sight they can still see you and you can hear
                           them shooting at you.
                           It is possible to get stuck in enemies and for
                           them to get stuck in each other.
                           Whether the rendering problems are related to my
                           ATI graphics card or not I am not sure.

                           MAP06 Half way up the comms tower an invisible
                                 wall blocks the rest of the way up, use
                                 no clip as a workaround.
                           MAP18 In one part of the map the idea is to get
                                 the monsters to fight each other so that
                                 you can sneak passed but this doesn't work
                                 in Risen3D (but you can just run passed
                                 anyway).
                           MAP22 Has problems rendering the RL room. (parts
                                 of the floor are invisible).
                                 Texture drawing problem in BFG secret area
                                 (middle texture not clipped).
                           MAP28 Has problems rendering the area near the
                                 exit (floor is invisible).
                           Other When a floor is raised and becomes a lift,
                                 the lift makes the floor raising sound
                                 when it is activated as well as the lift
                                 sound.
                                 When the player closes a switched door

                           MAP30 The auto aim prevents shooting the boss
                                 brain but there is an option to turn it
                                 off or use mlook.
                           MAP32 The music for MAP31 plays.
                                 Secret 22 is inaccessible, the barrel
                                 doesn't seem to activate the trigger.
                                 Secret 26 is inaccessible because the
                                 stairs to and from it don't build.
                                 On one playthrough the door at secret 04
                                 locked but I have not been able to 
                                 recreate this.
                           Some switch textures appear opposite (pressed
                           instead of unpressed and vice versa).
                           The built in GLBSP reports 2 minor warnings.
                           The raise and change texture trigger works
                           differently (sets texture to sector rather than
                           trigger) which can make the floors look odd.
                           When you teleport the player doesn't always face
                           the same way as the teleport destination thing.
                           Music seems to sound off key (using System
                           option).

                           MAP21 There was a problem with the monsters
                                 activating early from sound in one of the
                                 areas but I've modified the map to get
                                 around it.
                           MAP29 Vavoom crashed a couple of times while
                                 playing this map, not sure why.
                           Automap shows secret areas that would normally
                           be hidden.

                           Gameplay is slightly different because the
                           monsters behave differently (they can open
                           turbo doors).
