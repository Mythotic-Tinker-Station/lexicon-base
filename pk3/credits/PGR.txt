Description           : Perdition's Gate: Resurgence is an unofficial fan sequel to 
			Tom Mustaine's 1996 megawad Perdition's Gate. This wad takes 
			place immediatly after Perdition's Gate map 30, where doomguy 
			had just set off the bomb meant to destroy Earth in thevbomb 
			facility of Hell. The maps here were made to emulate the 
			mapping style of the four original Perdition's Gate level 
			designers, those being Tom & Bob Mustaine, along with 
			Jimmy Sieben, & Mackey McCandlish.
