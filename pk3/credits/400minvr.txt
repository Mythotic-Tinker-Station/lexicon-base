Description             : This project contains 37 maps, all made within 400
                          minutes (with a few exceptions,) inspired by the
                          previous X Minutes of /vr/ projects. All maps are
                          Boom-compatible and use rfhelltx.wad for textures.
                          UMAPINFO is utilized to supply special actions and
                          allow for a 37 map WAD. This set is intended to be
                          played in complevel 9 with a UMAPINFO compatible
                          port.
                          Also included in the zip is an extra WAD featuring
                          a non-widescreen HUD for ports that do not support
                          widescreen HUDs.
