Title                   : Team Rocket: Blasting Off at the Speed of Mapping (v1.1)
Filename                : trocket.wad
Release date            : 20 July 2018
Authors                 : Team Rocket
Email Address           : [redacted]

Description             : TEAM ROCKET comprises AD_79, Dragonfly, Jimmy and
                          MTrop, four experienced Doom mappers who together
                          endured a 20-hour speedmapping livestream. Their
                          efforts were supported by kind donators and guest
                          mappers who tagged in to let the fatigued rocketeers
                          recuperate. We bring you 34 maps, all made within
                          less than a day, shaped by you, our viewers.
              
Additional Credits to   : Baratus, our artistic cheerleader who posted
                          wholesome, motivating art in the Twitch chat while we
                          were mapping our socks off.
                          Skittles8059, our Almighty Lady Kinklord (and good
                          friend).
                          All the guest mappers who helped us achieve a full
                          megawad in such a short span of time!
                          All the texture artists and musicians whose work
                          we used to put this together. You are credited in the
                          trocket_credits.txt file.
