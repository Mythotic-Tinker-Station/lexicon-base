Description             : Jiffy Bag is a collection of 32 random maps made by me
                          over the last 5 years or so. The maps all vary quite
                          dramatically in theme, and are similar only in terms 
                          of size and design - given the short time I had to 
                          make these in, my general approach to mapping is
                          pretty obvious in how each map plays and is structured,
                          but this should hopefully contribute to a well-rounded,
                          consistent end product.

                          The maps come from a variety of sources and all of
                          them have received extensive balancing and other tune-
                          ups. The set as a whole is intended for continuous
                          play, but pistol starts should be viable too.

                          The music tracks featured in maps 1-31 are all speed-
                          MIDIs by me, and you can grab them on my Bandcamp 
                          under the four "30in30" speedMIDI albums.
                          
                          The optional jiffynames.wad file can be loaded with 
                          these maps in ZDoom-derivative ports to print the
                          map name and a snarky quote from the author on level
                          start.
