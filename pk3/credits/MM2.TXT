MEMENTO MORI - Operation two

Written by Alden Bates (alden@bates.wn.planet.gen.nz)


Restoration of earth is going well.  Major lines of communication
have been reopened and contact has been reestablished with earth's 
outer colonies.  It is almost a year since you battled the hell 
spawn for the second time.

It is day 727 of the rebuilding of earth, almost two years since
the first huge invasion which nearly destroyed earth. You are
overseeing the building of suburban residences when a black car
with reflective windows pulls up near the supervisor's van. Two
people in army uniform get out and walk over to you.  

The lead guy has a chest full of medals and swaggers like he's
earnt them.  Steel gray hair frames a face heavily lined with
experience.  The younger man is taller and thinner with dark hair
and glasses.

"I am General Kimmel, and you are getting into the car, soldier."
the first man says, simply and concisely. 

Realising you had been standing there slack jawed, you draw
yourself up to attention, march over to the car and get in.  The
general and his aide follow briskly.  You watch the bewildered looks
on your workers faces as the car moves away from the site.

The interior of the car is plainly furnished.  On the seat next to
you is a large metal box.  Opposite you sit General Kimmel and his
aide.  You decide to begin by asking the General what was so
important that you had to be dragged away from urban reconstruction.

The General replies "Lieutenant Bates has prepared your briefing." 

The Lieutenant reaches under the seat beneath him and produces a
clipboard.  "We re-established contact with the colony on Io three
weeks ago.  At that time, they reported that all was fine, though
they were beginning to run low on provisions.  Their last jupiter
probe had returned some anomalous readings.  After a relief ship was
dispatched, we expected to hear more news, but there was only
silence.  Then the distress call came."

"Our first idea was to send a team of our best agents in to scout
the area.  They arrived on Io about a week ago and two days ago,
the reports started filtering in by sub-space.  It looks like
another infestation.  Many of the scouts are in serious trouble,
some we haven't heard from since their initial reports." 

"We have a ship ready for launch in the next hour.  Space and
weight are both at a premium, so you are limited in the weapons
you can take."

The General turns back from contemplating the partly rebuilt city
flashing by, and asks: "Are you in?" 

You consider.  Either staying safely on earth helping to rebuild, or
trapped somewhere on one of jupiter's moons with only a pistol and
the cries of the dead to keep you company. 

"Sounds good to me."

The General smiles grimly and points to the box on the seat.  "In
there you will find a briefing module with reports from the agents
sent to Io.  You will have time to familiarize yourself with the
contents before the launch.  Good luck." 

In the box, you find a lightweight black slab, similar to a notebook
computer.  At the touch of a button, the screen lights up with the
words "MEMENTO MORI, OPERATION TWO". 

"Operation one was the mission you ran a year ago.  Memento mori is
latin.  It's a death's head, a reminder of those who died in the
invasion" the General translates.

Sector: 01
Agent assigned: Denis Moeller (d.moeller@rendsburg.netsurf.de)
Mission title: Outpost

Operation Memento Mori 2. This is your first mission out of 30.
Reports say that there are possibly 2 more sectors to get through,
but we don't have any detailed info on this.
Your mission now is pretty easy; get into sector 1 and save the
area. Report any contact you get, find out what happened out there.
A picture taken by our last drone doesn't show any activity, this
might have changed since the picture was taken 3 days ago.

Sector: 02
Agent assigned: David Davidson (driller@cris.com)
Mission title: The Feeding Pit

This is simple. We need to get deeper into the planet, so get going
and kill everything that moves. Should be a short trip.

Sector: 03
Agent assigned: Matthias Worch (matthias.worch@uni-essen.de)
Mission title: ...And Hell Beneath

Intelligence has reported a large underground complex in the 
ground of IO that is inhabited with monsters of all kinds. 
Several scouts have been sent into it and reported that the 
whole structure seems to have been built around a large cave, 
containing a deep pool of blood. From its ground evil laughter 
and more unnatural sounds can be heard.
Access to the pool is blocked by some barrier, so that nobody 
has been able to reach it so far, after short time the contact 
to one after another scout has been interrupted, their fate is 
unknown. The last scout was lost while being in a temple-like 
building, the last picture of his camera that was trans-mitted 
has been included with this file.

YOUR MISSION: 
- find the pool and close it before more monsters are able to 
  reach the moon 
- find the exit.

DO NOT LEAVE THE CAVE WITHOUT CLOSING THE POOL!

Sector: 04
Agent assigned: Florian Helmberger (helmberg@ins.at)
Mission title: Ratamahatta

You are being sent to a place quite deep in hell which is inhabited with
monsters of all kinds (you didn't expect that, did you?). We have sent 
Duck Nukem in to scout the area. He seems to not have achieved that much
(nothing but cool talk). Anyway, we include the last picture of his
HeadCam(tm) with this file - his last transmited words were: "This really
pisses me off!".

Go in there, kick butt and get out alive soldier!

Sector: 05
Agent assigned: Paul Noble (editor@elbon.demon.co.uk)
Mission title: Rites Of Passage

Ok marine, here is the mission based in sector 5 of the combat 
zone, we'll go through it step by step so you don't miss anything....

Infiltration. We have sent three scout marines into this area and 
only one has managed to make it back with what looks like a very 
disturbed combat senario, there were update reports from the marines 
who didn't make it back about several varying areas, spanning deadly 
molten lava to a semi civilised area. Marine 002002345 who was second 
into the zone managed to setup the Close Range Teleporter Enhancement 
Pad (CRTEP) which will allow you to beam directly to the area and 
bypass the initial enemy sentries...

Enemy deployments. The scout marines encountered varying forms of 
depraved fiends and also several zombified marines who are to be 
looked out for - see if you can appeal to their human side and then
they may help you. The 1st scout in was quickly dispatched by what 
looked like what we know as imps but the image was very badly effected 
by the site locations interference. Scout 2 managed to make it to a 
moat of burning lava before he was exploded by a massive energy 
discharge - viewing his bod-cam the bolt of energy seemed to emanate 
from over the moat. Third in managed to make it a bit further before 
he request evac, but his exploration has left him a jibbering wreak 
and it was only with intense electroshock therapy that we managed to
get any real information out of him. It seems that the self destruct 
switch for this bunker system is actually beyond the moat - how to get
to this or excatly where it is, is what you'll have to discover...

Armament. It seems that the demons have wised up to our CRTEP as they 
have scrambled the signal some what, when we beamed down your supplies
the equipment was spread through the combat area, so you'll have to go 
in with just the bare minimum as the CRTEP does not allow us to download 
you with too much mass so you'll only have your pistol and the faithful 
knuckle dusters.

Priority. Kill as many of the Hell Spawn as possible, and get out of 
there... Come back alive and you'll be awarded ice cream privilages for 
two whole weeks, oh and a medal I suppose.

Good Luck Marine, and Kick ASS!

Sector: 06
Agent assigned: Adam Williamson (Adam@scss.demon.co.uk)
Mission title: Trapped

Alright, listen up marine. We sent some scouts into this next zone, but
they didn't get very far. All but one had their cameras knocked out
immediately, and that one managed to get one picture back before it lost
the camera. The last transmission we got was...

"...Darkish corridors. A few traps. Keycard. Returning to previously
secured area. Using keycard...."

The transmission cuts out for a few minutes.

"Heading inside large building. Using lift. S**T! THE WALLS ARE
OPENING!!!!"

That is all we heard. It seems to indicate some large traps in operation
in this area, so be on your guard! Good luck.

Sector: 07
Agent assigned: David Kuykendall (lazarus@visi.net)
Mission title: Frustration

Finally you fight and frag your way out of hell, a sewer tunnel looms 
before you, light shines at the end.  Salvation!  You have beaten them!  
Not too hard you think to yourself, a cakewalk compared to last time...
Well, time to go home.  Humming to yourself you sling your shotgun over 
your shoulder you make your way to the exit, only to find that it is 
blocked!  
Well dammit, must be a way around...
how bout this ladder...?
Hmmm, maybe your not done yet...

Sector: 08
Agent assigned: Denis Moeller (d.moeller@rendsburg.netsurf.de)
Mission title: Stigmata

Civilians have reported that the hordes changed their Drinking Water 
Supply to a slime producing machine. The slime is now used to eliminate 
all human lifeform in this region. The civilians locked some of the 
doors to stop the demonic invasion, unfortunately it was too late.

Your mission target: find the keys, kill all demons and stop the slime 
machine. Then find the way back to your mission control and report 
what you've found. Don't come back without deactivating the machine!

Good luck.

Sector: 09
Agent assigned: Mark Klem (mark@netdoor.com)
Mission title: Sabbath Sewer

[Agent report follows]

We appear to be in some sort of inescapable hole inside the city.
My shotgun lies on the ground from where I dropped it when I fell
in this hole.  You know, like those idiots do in the movies.

We managed to pry up a manhole cover and toss it aside.  This is the
only way possible to get any further.

There is an old abandoned church here that is accessible from the sewers.
Heavily gaurded and they ain't preaching the gospel.
The church holds a super shotgun and some major health provisions.
The exit is here, but will require a blue key.
Better get movin'; there's no time to pray.

Sector: 10
Agent assigned: Matthias Worch (matthias.worch@uni-essen.de)
Mission title: Clear For Death

Well, sorry to tell you, but you'll have to descent into the sewers again. 
Your goal is area 11, but the entrance is located in sector 10 in an old 
sewage-farm that has been overtaken. The way into the actual 
sewage-system is secured by keycards - maybe you'll have to find them first.

Sector: 11
Agent assigned: Eric Sargent (esargent@netdoor.com)
Mission title: Sewer Shutdown

You need to get into the city and check for signs of life.  The best
route is through the sewers.  By the time you reach this point, you
should be at the heart of the sewer processing facility - and the
city.  Since the demons have invaded, little is known about the
state of this facility, but this image from one of our scouts may
help.  We do know it is not 100% operational.  It must have been
damaged in some way.  You must reach the central point of the
processing facility and shut it down.  Once the system has been shut
down, you should be able to obtain access to the city.

Sector: 12
Agent assigned: Orin Flaharty (akira963@ix.netcom.com)
Mission title: The Waterway

Your mission is to enter the area and clear out all remaining enemy
resistance. Take out as many demons as you can and move on to the
next area.

Troop #93 Report: Thin walkways over underground rivers make up the
majority of this area. The huge underground caverns that make up this area
are filled with some of the weaker Hellspawn, but we did see signs that
larger demons had been here.

Sector: 13
Agent assigned: Rhys Hughes (hughesr@azh.bt.co.uk)
Mission title: Devils Paradise

Okay troopers listen up. This is area 13 also known to the corp as 
DEVILS PARADISE. You better be paying attention marines because I'm
not sending no damn recon team down there to bail you out. Okay? 

Right now, we are lead to belive that the damn hellspawn that were
sending you in to wipe out have got thier hands on one of our A-bombs.
Its up to you to go in, locate the threat and take care of it. There 
are some Arachnotrons located round in area 13 and they have some kind
of psychic link to the A-bomb. Intelligence informs us that if you 
take care of them you'll take care of the bomb too. However fail to do
this and you'll never leave that place alive...
			  
This just in marines. Intelligence informs us that they have located a
living mass of somekind in the lower reaches of DEVILS PARADISE. We 
don't know what the hell it is but we can confirm that it posesses 
regenerative capabilities. So be on your toes at all times.

Mission title: A Question Of Time

Hmm, we don't have much information about this thing. What we
know is: You'll have to reach Area 15 quickly, and teleporter leading there 
is located in this building - so you'll probably have to go through it.

Sector: 15
Agent assigned: Adam Windsor (windsora@pigeon.qut.edu.au)
Mission title: The Devil's Coterie

One of the first areas to be overrun by the Demons in this 
latest infestation was an old UAC industrial and storage facility.
We managed to have some reconnaissance pictures taken of the exterior, 
the clearest of which has been provided for this briefing. Although at 
that time the Demons were keeping out of sight, and we were unable to 
get any hard data on their numbers or strength, recent long range scans
suggest significant infestation, and energy discharges matching those 
of teleport units in action have been detected.  We anticipate a very 
hot reception for you.  Watch your six, and don't be caught napping - 
there's no telling what traps the Demons have in store.

Sector: 16
Agent assigned: Denis Moeller (d.moeller@rendsburg.netsurf.de)
Mission title: The Nephilim

Sector 16 used to be a big hightech area, dedicated to research of
new teleporter facilities. Contact to this region lost a week ago,
detailed information follows.

The guy we sent into sector 16 didn't make it back; all we know is
that the enemies came in from the west. Reports say that there seems 
to be a real big enemie somewhere, but we don't have any further
info on this. The picture was one of the last received, vital signs
suddenly disappeared a few seconds after transfer.

Primary mission target: 
Teleport into this sector, eliminate all enemies and find your way 
back, report what happened to our troops and what's left of the 
computers. 

Secondary mission target: 
Find out more about that big enemy.

Agent assigned: Michael S. Rapp (michael.rapp@aquila.com)
Mission title: No One (Ever Comes From Here)

Reports from Sector 17 have been unclear. Every scout sent in to 
investigate the situation has not made it back alive. It seems 
that no one, ever comes from here. Now it's time to send in the
big boys, that means you Marine. 

Your mission is to find a way to get to Sector 18.

[local] - Start transmission BUILDerman (AZ375B) -

"Hi, this is scout Ken BUILDerman, reporting from the refinery in 
sector 18. I have penetrated the base so far and not encountered 
anything harmfull, to be honest I don't think there's anything bad in 
this base, the evacuation was senseless. But of course you had to waste 
my brilliant talent on something like this and... - ah, never mind.
I had to use some of the refinery's equipment to get here - some of 
the doors seem to be stuck, I'm off to reactivate the power generator.
As you can see at the picture I'm sending you right now everything is 
fine, I won't need any hel...brzbrzbrzbrz."

Sector: 19
Agent assigned: Jeremy Statz (jstatz@win.bright.net)
Mission title: The Shaft

The single scout sent into the mission 19 combat zone never returned.
We've had to extrapolate almost everything about this area from the 
images and radio messages transmitted before the scout's demise in a 
temple-like area.

So far as we can tell, the 19th CZ is some sort of mining facility,
entirely underground.  The hellspawn have taken it over, and have been 
building onto it heavily.  We estimate the structure is nearly twice as
large as we originally expected.  The ultimate purpose of the structure
is unknown.

Mission priority is simply to wipe out the infestation.  Leave nothing
moving, if possible.  Secondary priority is the discover the structure's
purpose.  So far as we can tell, there's little reason to the 
schizophrenic mess of structures making up this CZ.  If there's an 
ultimate purpose, we'd like to know what it is.

Sector coverage: 
Laboratories, Grade-A clearance required for assess to data.

Agent report follows:
I have gained access to the laboratories and observed some of 
the monsters at work.  I don't know what this place was used for
before the invasion, it looks like [portion of text censored] and
the creatures seem to be using it for something.

At the moment I have reached the first laboratory.  It looks to 
have carved from a natural underground cavern.  Some of the small
spider brains are supervising some zombies who are working on the
[portion of text censored] and conducting what look like light-wave
experiments.  I thought I recognised one of the zombies, it may be 
a friend of mine.  I'm going to try and make contact.

Later I'm hoping to go deeper into the labs. It sounds like they're 
testing heavy weapons further in.

Sector: 21
Agent assigned: Andy Badorek (migru@vg3.chemie.uni-konstanz.de)
Mission title: Sanctuary

Okay marines, you are in for trouble. Massive enemy activity has been 
reported in your destination area, strategically important places have 
been occupied by large numbers of enemy forces. 

Our scout team has reported that enemy forces concentrate around a place
called SANCTUARY, which seems to be of special interest to the enemy.
Unfortunately the scout team could not get close enough because the 
entryway was locked and surrounding buildings were well guarded.

Your task is to jump in and clear the area of enemy presence, then 
proceed in order to find SANCTUARY, and, if possible, find out why it 
is important to the enemy. 

The scout team has discovered abandonned ammonition stocks in several 
places but you are advised to keep count on your ammo or you'll end up
throwing stones at those beasts. You may expect massive opposition and
ambush attacks.

Before we lost contact with our scouts they reported a sudden rocket 
attack in a large square room in the most western part of your destination 
area. It is probably better to avoid that room if you want to make it 
home in one piece.

Good luck.

Sector: 22
Agent assigned: Thomas Moeller (t.moeller@rendsburg.netsurf.de)
Mission title: Reactor Related Fuel Refinary

The 22nd sector of our base at IO is our fuel refinary which
produced fuel materials to enable electricity on IO's base by
using special reactors.
Scout transmissions report, that the monsters have modified
it for their own use. We have vague thoughts, that they
replicate themselfes with it, especially those monsters
we call "pigs". Bio scanners report heavy-armored lifeforms
in the north-eastern part of the sector - prepare yourself.

Mission objective: Eliminate all intruders, means clean the
                   sector and re-establish a working refinary
                   (if possible).

Special note: We can't equip you with heavy weapons this time
              cause the transmitters to this sector are damaged.
              So, look out for something you can use. Good luck.

The demons have sealed the emergency evacuation route and we can't
get out.  We've sent several scouts in an attempt to find another
exit, but all attempts have failed.  We did manage to get an image
of the complex from one of the scouts before we lost contact with
him.  Send someone to move through the complex and find an alternate
route.  Please hurry...  the demons are closing in on the area we
have barricaded ourselves in.

Mission title: Io Lab

This region was one of the first human on Io. The technics are old 
and of no use, but the enemy might be interested in it. We don't 
expect any humans in there, since these buildings were closed months 
ago. The thing is, when you're back we don't want to have ANY creature 
out there anymore. So, get going. Nice and easy, you've got plenty 
of time for this.

Sector: 25
Agent assigned: Denis Moeller (d.moeller@rendsburg.netsurf.de)
Mission title: Forgotten Town

Sector 25 used to be a residential district. Since most of the
working places on this planet seem to be attacked by the evil 
hordes, we are anxious about the civilians living in sector 25. 
We didn't send any scouts in it, because this region always was 
very safe and there are still no known security problems.

The picture was taken by the local camera system about 10 hours
ago - the missing enemy movement and the silence of this area
shows that it should be no problem for you. We need to get all
humans out of this sector before any enemies try to attack.

Mission objectives: get in and evacuate all civilians. Seal all
doors and leave the sector.

There's no doubt that this will be your easiest mission, there
are no plans for fighting - if you encounter any enemy troops,
retreat immediately.

cyberdemons.  The reports that I received indicates that a few wildly 
placed rockets from one of the cyberdemon lords blew away a massive 
amount of wall structure revealing what may be an underground base of 
some sort.  After me and a few others suited up, we locked on the 
coordinates of the base and went in...

The entrance to the blown out wall is pretty high in radioactivity.
The good news is; there isn't very much of it at all.  Looks like
most of it has dried up over the days.  It was pretty well guarded
by a team of former human sargents, and a few "pinkos" were placed
down a hall for a surprise attack from behind.

There also appears to be some sort of holding cell here for other
demons.  There must be a way in there, because a few items are visible.

Deeper inside the metal encased operational facility is a red key, which
is important to acquire if you ever want to leave this sector.  If things
start heatin' up, the sargents will move this key to another area.

There is a teleporter revealed after you get the key which will take you
back to the upper level of the base.  But getting to it may deliver a
slight problem; death.

On the way to the exit, there will be many creatures that will do their
best to stop you from getting out.  The exit is trapped, so watch it.

Agent assigned: Paul Noble (editor@elbon.demon.co.uk)
Mission title: The Silos

Sit down Marine, make yourself comfortable, for once this mission 
starts there won't be any rest, not even for the wicked...

Mission Objectives. This mission is imperative to the success of 
Operation Memento Mori 2, the missile base which you'll be dropped
into has fallen into the hands of the enemy, they don't know what 
they've got but we do. The site is a Guidance array and missile 
launch centre. Our Space Marines have been fighting a continuous 
battle in the space around the orbital platforms and have managed
to force the main bulk of the demon hoards onto the biggest orbital 
platform (codenamed Icarus), unfortunately this platform is very
well armed and we cannot make a landing on the platform to reclaim 
it. Thus it has been decided that it is to be destroyed utterly. 
To this ends you must enter the missile base, reconfigure the missile 
guidance array in the South East corner to point to the space platform, 
then you must seal all the silos ready for launch - all the silos have 
a double lock mechanism, make sure that all the lock switches are 
activated. Then finally you must activate the launch sequence, once
done we can beam you off the base and onto your next mission.

Infiltration. We have set up a drop site near the old Sentry gateway, 
this area should still have some weapons stocks of some sort near by...

Enemy deployments. Reports claim that the Missile base is infested 
with all manner of humanoid killers, be they demon possessed troopers 
or the evils known as Mancabus, they are high tech, but in the brain 
department they are not up to much - think before you run in, if you 
can get them fighting each other then they'll do half your work for you. 
You'll find that there are serious concentrations of enemy operatives 
the further you progress through the base, be prepared for all manner 
of opposition...

Priority. Seal all the missile silos and erect the missile guidance 
array, then get the hell out of there.
 
This is going to be one helluva mission and the Earth Force are relying 
on you, make em eat hot lead death!

Sector: 28
Agent assigned: Stephen Watson (steve@flash.speedware.com)
Mission title: Corporate Hell

Mission Objective: Reach the top of the UAC corporate tower and 
secure the area by destroying all Hellspawn.

Initial Scout Report: Before contact was lost with the four scouts 
sent in to perform preliminary recognaissance, they managed to send
the following information:

The UAC corporate compound is split up into two areas: A product 
testing facility and the corporate arcology super towers.

A short-distance localized Teleporter Pad was set up by a scout in the
product testing sector and that is where you will start the mission.
Primary mission objectives here will be threefold: (1) clear the area of
the hellspawn infestation, (2) acquire a security key that will allow
entry into the corporate arcology super towers, and (3) locate and 
activate the switch that will open access to the teleporter pad that 
will take you to the coporate arcology sector.

Scouts reported that the Key should be located in the Southwest building,
the teleporter pad is the Northeast structure, and a switch allowing 
access to the teleporter pad is in the Central building. 

Strategy: Watch your back, Marine. You will be exposed from all sides in
this area. Just keep moving and let the monsters take each other out. 
Conserve your ammo, scouts report you will need it in the next area...

The Corporate Arcology is a collection of five towers and three 
skyscrapers. Your Primary Mission objectives here will be: (1) gain 
access to the highest floors by progressively hitting various security 
switches in the four 'satelitte' towers, (2) clear the area of Hellspawn, 
(3) once on the highest floor, take the teleporter to clear out the final 
West building to finish the mission.

Scouts reported that each of the four towers attached off of the central
tower house a Security Switch will allow the central elevator to
reach the next higher level. The path to each of these towers is marked
by a blue square which switches to black once you have come into 
proximity of a Security Switch. You may use this as a marker to tell 
where you have already been. Once in a 'satellite' tower, remember to 
check carefully for the Security Switch and to hit it. Otherwise you will 
waste valuable time backtracking. These Security Switches are recognizable
by their proximity to a short techlamp.

The South building houses a security key that may be used in the West
building to resupply yourself if necessary.

Be careful in this sector, as there are several nasty ambushes that have
been devised by the more 'corporate minded' Hellspawn. Don't waste your
ammo.

Scouts marked key areas with Florescent Arrows. Look for them, they 
provide clues to pressure pads that activate lifts, or may contain 
caches of Ammo and Medical supplies.

Mission title: Kings Of Metal

Hmm. We seem to be quite near something REAL big, so watch out. 
28 sectors are ours, let's bring this to an end. Obviously one of
your last missions on IO - enjoy the violence!

Agent assigned: Jim Wraith (jim@kildare.demon.co.uk)
Mission title: It

Well soldier, it doesn't look good..  All we've received from the
target is a crackly radio transmission, from which we could only
discern the fact that the area is *very* dangerous, and if the
conditions weren't such we'd arm you with a H-Bomb.  There's not
much after this though.. Get past this one and you're home free..
Good luck trooper!

If you read THIS far, here is a hint for 2 super-super-super-secret 
levels. They are stored somewhere in the whole MM2 thing and they 
will appear as Map01 (by Steve Towle) and Map02 (by Thomas Moeller). 
(I'm not talking about the 2 secret levels, everybody knows about).

[Problems?]

  Q1: Everytime I start Doom 2 with the MM2 WADs, it breaks after
      a short while. What the hell?
  A1: MM2's ingame Demos are recorded with v1.9, you prolly use an
      older version. Update Doom 2 or be quick enough to start a game
      before Doom 2 kicks you.

  Q2: Modem play doesn't work, it just won't run.
  A2: Use id's DeathManager and try leaving the music WAD (MM2MUS.WAD).

  Q3: We played MM2 Co-Op and saved a game. Now how can we go on 
      later, loading the saved game?
  A3: Try '-loadgame x' at the command line for the DeathManager, x 
      being the number of your saved game. Read Doom 2's readme.

  Q4: How come this Add-On is for Doom 2, not Quake? 
  A4: Because building started months ago and Quake just happened to
      be out too early (doh!).

  Q5: I heared there are 2 super-super-super-secret levels somewhere, 
      come on, tell me how to get there!
  A5: No.

  Q666: Are you guys nuts? MM2 is soooo awesome, what can I do to
        help you guys spreading this incredible Add-On?
  A666: Let everyone know about MM2, post to newsgroups, let id know,
        copy it, copy it, copy it, visit our Homepage... etc :)

  Q7: Have you guysgot no life, no other interest that you can do 
      something this cool?
  A7: No, thats why you can expect Memento Mori III - The Quake Encounter.
