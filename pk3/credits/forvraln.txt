Description             : Born from the idea to dedicate a map to one of
                          your favorite characters, this wad contains 23
                          maps referencing a fictional character (also called
                          waifu) be it with their layout, textures, or overall
                          theme. Aiming for Boom format with UMAPINFO and MUSINFO,
                          maps were made using the OTEX texture set and up to 5
                          custom textures per map themed around the depicted
                          character.
