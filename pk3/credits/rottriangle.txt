Misc. Author Info       : Fuck war, make wad.

Description             : Low budget alert! It has gotten so bad the
                          environment, and even your head have turned into
                          the least cost-effective shapes to draw; triangles,
                          with each map only using 100 linedefs.
                          You must find the bottle reusing center as soon as
                          possible, and deposit all your used health bonuses,
                          before your world runs out of money and ceases to
                          exist. Unluckily for you the Icon of Sin's (twin?
                          No. Triplet? No. Quadruplet? No.) infinite-let
                          sister has invaded earth, and swallowed the entire
                          reuse center before returning to hell. You must go
                          after her.
