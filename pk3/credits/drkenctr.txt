Description         Updated version of Dark Encounters megawad.
		Fixes/Changes:
	
	All difficulty settings are now available (previously implemented HMP and UV only).
	Replaced all "thing" actions with linedef actions or scripts for better compatiblity with mods.
	Fixed issues with co-op players becoming stuck behind closing doors/walls etc. Any lock outs/ins where the player 
		has no other way out/in will be on a reasonable timer.
	Adjusted/added monster and ammo count for co-op and, to a lesser degree, in single player.
	Map01 chainsaw secret now recognized by mods that did not trigger it.
	Map06 Removed several burning barrels that were causing performance issues with some mods.
	Map09 Yellow Key no longer triggers lowering sector twice, trapping the player.
	Map13 Red Door is now set as repeatable action.
	Map20 removed some invisible blocking lines that impeded player movement.
	Map26 moved shootable switch as players were often getting stuck here.
	Map31 added more monsters to final battle as it was underwhelming.
	Increased font size on HUD messages.
	Mouse look is REQUIRED for a few secrets and shootable switches. (This was incorrectly listed as "mouse look recommended")

Story:

    : "I knew they would come back some day...The leaders
                          and generals of the world were content with their
                          victory...my victory...heh. Never been much for
                          parades, so I slipped back into my role as a
                          good-ole space marine. I argued for a time about
                          the potential for another invasion. Like before,
                          they said their "new" technology would handle any
                          threat. Yeah...sure it will...
                          I...knew...they...would...come...back..."
                          ***Please see text file for gameplay
                          information.***



 In This Wad...
                          No jumping/crouching, mouse-look required in a few cases.
                          Gameplay is in the style of the original Doom 2.
                          Difficulty is slightly harder than Doom2 with encounters
                          of varying difficulty thrown in through-out the maps. 
                          Survival will require accuracy, agility, ammo management, spacial 
                          awareness, and the following...

                          ****On Hurt Me Plenty****
                          Employ at least ONE of these approaches to avoid running out of ammo, or 
                          use them all to have ammo-a-plenty.
                              1.Find the secrets (most are not hard to find)...or
                              2.Explore the entire map...or
                              3.Use the berserk/chainsaw on targets of opportunity (my personal favorite). 
                          ****On Ultra Violence****
                          Employ at least TWO of the above approaches to avoid running out of ammo, or 
                          use them all to have ammo-a-plenty.
                          ****On Pistol Start****
                          Employ ALL THREE of the above approaches to avoid running out of ammo.

                          For best effect use dynamic lights, but sector lighting is implemented
                          for better performance.
