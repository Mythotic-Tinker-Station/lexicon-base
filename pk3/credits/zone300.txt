Description             : A 32 level megawad of small maps for Doom 2. Your 
			  mission is simple. Blast you way through techbases, 
			  dungeons and hellish abodes and save Earth from
			  extinction. These maps contain no more than 300 
			  linedefs apart from the much larger super secret
			  level. Zone 300 = Short, quick and simple.

Credits			: id for Doom, Codeimp for Doom Builder, and the
			  authors of all the other software.
 
Design Info		: Well after months of inactivity in mapping I 
			  thought I'd surprise you all with a new release.
			  I wanted to challenge myself to make a complete 
			  32 map megawad with a complete original musical 
			  score in less than 2 months. The maps on average 
			  contain around 50 to 100 monsters. The good thing 
			  about smaller maps that it was much easier for me 
			  to get the gameplay balance right. Inspired by
			  Doomworld's 100 linedef project I thought to myself
			  you could make decent levels with no more than 300
			  linedefs. It should run with Vanilla Doom2.exe.
			  As you know I do not make slaughter maps so the 
			  difficulty of the maps are comparable to id's
			  maps and if you find it too easy you can always
			  play it with -fast monsters or on nightmare 
			  difficutly. Multiplayer and DM are supported and
			  there is extra multiplayer stuff in the maps such
			  as weapons for DM. The Icon of Sin also looks a bit
			  different in MAP30, its now greyscale and negative
			  and has a new name "The Icon of Damnation" deep
			  within the Eternal Core. The music is all original
			  although the intermission contains the remix of
			  the Doom 2 readme song used in Doom 2 Unleashed 
			  (aka Pcorf Community Project). I wanted new music
			  because you always hear the usual music replacements
			  in megawads from other games like Duke3D and Rott.
			  Enough is a enough so now go and load up Zone 300 
			  and try to beat it as fast as you can. All maps are 
			  playable from a pistol start.
