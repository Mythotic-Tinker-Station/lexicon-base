Project Information:

I would like to thank the Doom Community for their help in getting this project off the
ground!  You need either Boom/PrBoom or ZDoom to play it!  I didn't do any of the maps,
graphics, music and anything else that might be included in this wad!  I just coordinated
the effort, the following people get all the credit for their work on this project!
