                     Another extraordinary Doom II add-on
                                       
                            from Wraith Corporation
                                       
                                       

            Tired of levels even your 10 year-old sister can beat?

               But are you man enough to open Perdition's Gate?


    Each of the 32 levels in the Full Edition of PERDITION'S GATE makes for an
extremely difficult experience in single player mode, with innovative level
architecture further defining the "classic" feel.  Monsters, health, armor, and
ammo have all been skillfully arranged to ensure that PERDITION'S GATE is
difficult, but not impossible, for players of all skill levels.  Levels are
also riddled with secret areas and items; you'll want to play then again and
again trying to find every last secret.

    That's not all, however. PERDITION'S GATE has been designed with deathmatch
in mind.  Each of the 32 levels plays fast in deathmatch, giving even the most
demanding players a roaring good time.  Non-linear levels also add to the
deathmatch experience -- players will find there are several ways to reach key
areas, and setting up ambushes or brute force attacks!

   Deathmatch will never be the same again once you play PERDITION'S GATE -- 
other wads just won't cut it!
