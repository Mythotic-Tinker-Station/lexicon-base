Description             : A megawad compilation of maps made by /vr/ users.
                          Participants were asked to make a map in 300 minutes,
                          with an initial two-week deadline period for
                          submission. There was no particular theme beyond
                          vanilla compatibility / no custom textures.

                          At deadline 25 maps had been submitted, so it was
                          decided to allow extra time to complete the set;
                          also the previously submitted maps were bugfixed and
                          polished, and finally the wad released to /idgames.

                          Post-release update: the initial /idgames upload was
                          found to be incomplete, so it was agreed to allow a
                          further period of updates, bugfixing, and polishing.

                          Please note the maps are intended for pistol starts.

Note:        As submitted, the map had thousands of tiny detail sectors.
             It also had enough ammunition to annihilate a small country.
             Both have been greatly reduced, for the respective sakes of
             visplanes, and sanity.

Author:      Permuband
Submission:  15
Note:        Post-release work done to this probably went a bit beyond the
             remit of simple bugfixing, but the final confrontation couldn't
             be left alone after feedback mocked how easy it was to skip the
             whole thing entirely.

Music:       D_TENSE from cchest3.wad, by John "The Green Herring" Cage
Note:        Nothing in this map is unintentional. The lack of music, the
             final battle that is so optional it doesn't even start until
             you're standing on the exit, dozens of apparently spurious
             secret areas (update: these are gone now)

Music:       "Course Select" from Thunder Force IV
Note:        You can run out of visplanes if you are terribly unlucky. Doing
             something about this would likely ruin the map though. It has
             already been cut down significantly.

Title:       The Punch Dimension
Author:      Dogman
Submission:  21
Music:       Age of Empires 2 OST (I Will Beat on Your Behind)
Note:        Unfortunately relies on ZDoom physics for punching a few
             monsters, but they're all avoidable, or can eventually be dealt
             with in other ways. 100% kills wasn't really intended, but is
             possible. One monster being stuck in a wall is intentional.

Note:        Map required considerable visplane reduction; some doors were
             not meant to keep closing, but it was found to be necessary to
             keep the visible detail down. cf. ksutra, pl2.
