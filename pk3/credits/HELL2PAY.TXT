HELL TO PAY(tm), a DOOM II pwad by Wraith Corporation, is the most complete 
and most advanced DOOM 2 pwad created to date. Each of the 32 levels, highly 
optimized for difficuly yet fun play by Novices, Intermediates, and Expert 
players, is chock full of realistic new graphics and excellent playability.

HELL TO PAY is centered around a plot more detailed than that of any DOOM II
wad ever made; you become your character as he battles his way out of the
Holding Cells and fights the horrors that wait in the ordeals of the Slave
Quarters, Industrial Park, Space Port, space ship, Io Base, and, finally,
Planet Hell itself.

After playing each level, you are treated to original artwork and text which
reveals important plot information about the next level.

The wonders don't stop there. You will be mezmerized by levels containing
real-world objects you can look at and, in most, cases interact with.

HELL TO PAY has cranes, hologram projectors, blood processors, trucks, a
spaceship, rocket launches, even a life-sized computer!  As well as some
of the most challenging tricks and traps ever devised.

Each level of Hell To Pay has been carefully tuned to ensure the levels give
players of any skill a challenge, while keeping difficulty balanced.

Be warned!! The Skill Level "Wrath of Hell" has been made tuned to give even
the most Elite gamers a stiff challenge while "Extreme Prejudice" is designed
for the World's Best only!

     HELL TO PAY. It's more than 32 new levels. It's an experience.
