Difficulty is scaled internally. This map set overall should be a little tougher than Doom II, but not as hard as something like Plutonia or Alien Vendetta.

===================

Map:		01
Name:		Drop Pod Excursion
Difficulty:	Very Easy
Music:		Thin Lizzy - The Boys Are Back In Town

Story:		You use a drop pod to land in a local park, before pushing North through a house to a secret UAC Bunker.

Notes:		Although the street and park are fictitious, the house featured is very much a "MYHOUSE.WAD" take on my flat at the time of mapping/writing. One of the secrets is a little awkward to trigger, but if you step on the sector the powerup is in, you'll get it. I like the little flourish of the door blowing off of your drop pod and killing a Demon that was in the way. This map was in the 6-map demo released on the day this project was commemorating. The "PLOTLINE" texture was a late addition as a lot of people didn't like having an invisible wall on the road. It's visible now!

===================

Map:		02
Name:		Bunker Buster
Difficulty:	Easy
Music:		KISS - Detroit Rock City

Story:		The UAC bunker hasn't held back the demons, so you'll have to battle them on your way through to the nearby city.

Notes:		Probably one of my favourites from this set - I really like the MIDI and the light, breezy combat. The central area can get a bit hairy if you get unlucky with damage taken, but you shouldn't find this difficult on your chosen difficulty. This map was also in the 6-map demo. I'd seen KISS live not long before making this map, which may explain a thing or two...

===================

Map:		03
Name:		Urban Renewal
Difficulty:	Easy
Music:		In Flames - Pinball Map

Story:		The streets are locked down, so you'll need to work your way through the buildings to establish a safe zone.

Notes:		Scholars of my work may notice that this map is built from the inaccesible areas of Urban Escape, a 2014 speed map I made for wildweasel's birthday, with the accessible areas of that map forming a backdrop to this one. This map was also in the 6-map demo.

===================

Map:		04
Name:		Wasted Luxury
Difficulty:	Easy
Music:		AC/DC - Hell Ain't A Bad Place To Be

Story:		Having made your way into a corrupted luxury apartment complex, you'll need to access the restricted UAC areas in order to make your way to the roof.

Notes:		This map became a development speed bump as I tried to rush it to get the 6-map demo in time, hence MAP04, 05 and 06 of the demo being cherry-picked from later in the megaWAD, and this map not being in it. I think it turned out pretty well in the end, and for continuous players the secret here will be very welcome! Both apartments are "MYHOUSE.WAD"-style renditions of flats I've previously lived in, although the bigger one is a very loose, incomplete interpretation.

===================

Map:		05
Name:		Skyline
Difficulty:	Easy-Medium
Music:		Led Zeppelin - Achilles Last Stand

Story:		Now you've made it to the roof, you can push towards a teleporter that can move you to a key UAC location.

Notes:		One of the biggest maps in the set, at least partially to take advantage of another great MIDI. The secret in this map is pretty major, particularly for continuous players. Probably another contender for favourite of mine from this set.

===================

Map:		06
Name:		Destination Defenestration
Difficulty:	Medium
Music:		In Flames - Free Fall

Story:		The compound over the road from this facility will provide a route to the heavily-infested industrial sector, where the demons are engaged in some kind of organised activity. Despite the mounting opposition and tricky progress, you'll have to keep going!

Notes:		After the big MAP05, we have this smaller map that makes more use of dangerous enemies. I was mostly keen on using the name as I think "defenestration" is an inherently funny word, and it was a good excuse to have the player throw themselves out of a window. Once you're outside, you'll need to climb the pipework and then make a slightly fiddling hop onto the roof of the space-pickup to get over the wall. Difficulty-wise, this map may rank a little higher on the "medium" scale than some of the following maps (your mileage may vary). Thematically, it's where it needs to be!

===================

Map:		07
Name:		Rat Run
Difficulty:	Medium
Music:		Chimaira - Implements of Destruction

Story:		Having accessed a service tunnel, you've got some dark, confined spaces between you and your goal.

Notes:		This level is almost entirely a straight, linear gauntlet, and was originally made for the now-cancelled Triacontathlon, which was to be a set of 30 maps each made to a different "Gimmicky Challenge". The challenge this map was built to was having exactly 25 monsters on each difficulty. To adapt this from the older, high-difficulty set, I changed the monster count and composition and beefed up the player supplies and arsenal. The MIDI was a bit disappointing and doesn't cover the whole song, or end very well, so I used it in a short map where it won't matter. As a bit of trivia, this map ates back to some time in 2014, making it comfortably the oldest map in the set. Most ex-Triacontathlon maps in this set come from 2016-2018.

===================

Map:		08
Name:		Constriction
Difficulty:	Medium
Music:		Three Days Grace - Drown

Story:		This vine-choked facility will need to be unlocked in order to access the archeological site that's the next step on your journey.

Notes:		Another Triacontathlon map, this time built to the ever-popular 1024 restriction. I've cut back on difficulty significantly in order to make this map fit, but I think it's better for it. The corridor of doors is certainly less frustrating!

===================

Map:		09
Name:		Skulking Death
Difficulty:	Medium
Music:		In Flames - Jester Race

Story:		These dusty, flooded ruins used to serve some unknown purpose - now they're the muddy road to another teleporter, this one of an unguessable vintage.

Notes:		Previously "Creeping Death" from Triacontathlon, I changed the name because I'm not actually using that Metallica song and it didn't make much sense otherwise, in a set full of MIDI covers. The challenge this time around was "Exactly 50 monsters on all difficulties", which I kept in place this time, but altered the monster composition and supply provision in order to take the edge off. Spoiler alert: The Spider Mastermind can be telefragged... Or possibly killed by the chaingunners in front of it if you're careful!

===================

Map:		10
Name:		Haste Keep
Difficulty:	Medium
Music:		Three Days Grace - Home

Story:		Finally, the ruined keep holding the teleporter you're after. It might be ancient, but it definitely works and will take you to another dig site, near the industrial sector. We're getting close to seeing what these demons are up to!

Notes:		Another Triacontathlon conversion, this time a 2-hour speed map that's seen plenty of polish, development and a little expansion (thus no longer even remotely qualifying for the challenge.) Again, I had to add supplies to get this one ready for this megaWAD. You may notice that in this map, in GZDoom and related ports, there's green gibbed marines in the nukage - they're a DECORATE replacement for GibbedMarineExtra (Bloody Mess 2) and only cosmetic.

===================

Map:		11
Name:		Bloody Denial
Difficulty:	Medium
Music:		Chimaira - Down Again

Story:		This large archeological site seems to have been some sort of temple, most easily accessed by a UAC teleporter at one end (your goal) and the possibly-ancient teleport you've just taken.

Notes:		Yet another Triacontathlon challenge map - this time 100 monsters on every difficulty setting. I preserved the challenge but had to take the difficulty down a fair bit and make some alterations to the start, as this followed Constriction in it's original set. I have spotted some thin slime trails in the dark caves section of this map using prboom+ on complevel 2, but the uneven geometry down there seemed to be very good at producing them with any minor tweak.

===================

Map:		12
Name:		Emerald Fluid
Difficulty:	Medium
Music:		In Flames - Egonomic

Story:		You've made it! The smog, toxins and haze in the air confirm that you've made it to the industrial sector. You're not in deep enough yet, given all of the effluent and oddly-green vines in view, so you'll have to keep pushing further.

Notes:		The end of a run of six Triacontathlon maps - this "Five Rooms of Doom" challenge map was built to make maximum use of each of the five rooms, requiring each to be travelled to at least twice. Again, difficulty had to be lowered, and I also made a major change to enemy placement in the central room so that autoaim issues with distant imps could be avoided. This map was originally called "Emerald Sky" and was built to show off the second sky of Triacontathlon in the first room. Obviously the sky in this megaWAD isn't green, so I changed the name, but like that it shows the episode transition still. Incidentally, this sky is awesome, but displays very differently between GZDoom and prboom+, making it a little awkward to show off properly.

===================

Map:		13
Name:		Caldera
Difficulty:	Medium
Music:		Fear Factory - Replica

Story:		Teleporting to this facility hasn't gotten you to the source of the demon activity yet, but you're quite near a space port that must still have functional ships in. Getting on one of those should be all you need to progress your mission.

Notes:		This was the third-to-last map I made for this project (I started at the end and worked back to begin with, before picking "key" maps to make) and takes inspiration from 'Cauldren' in my 2005 ZDoom megaWAD, Scourge - a poorly-spelled map name for a basic realisation of a concept that's way older - unlocking progress around a damaging pit. The lighting effect in the middle was very awkward to implement, as complevel 2 (and therefore vanilla Doom II) don't treat the "light change to brightest adjacent" line action in the expected way, taking brightness information from the sectors either side of the calling line, rather than the sectors around tagged sector like one would hope (and indeed, Boom and other, more advanced ports do). This means that the effect I've implemented only has two phases in complevel 2, rather than the intended three, whilst the effect had three in complevel 9 or GZDoom, but they don't progress like intended even so. In the future, I think I'll stick to more advanced complevels, where possible! This map has a minor concession to multiplayer, as I've seen it played by the ZDaemon Thursday Night Survival crew and was the most likely to lock players out with the yellow key card (of course, this is still in no way designed for multiplayer!). Making progression work in complevel 2 involved some serious tweaking even when I thought the map was finished, a further encouragement to stick to more advanced level formats and their more forgiving handling of line actions!

===================

Map:		14
Name:		Water Treatment
Difficulty:	Medium
Music:		Three Days Grace - Overrated

Story:		You'll need to take a service access route from this facility to get to the star port, but as the whole area is one huge, interconnected industrial ecosystem, that's not as bad as it sounds.

Notes:		The second-to-last Triacontathlon map in the set, this map was originally called "Blank Space" because I simply hadn't thought of a name for it. Likewise, I can't remember at the time of writing what the challenge actually was for this map - it just seems like "a map" that needed to be toned down a bit and altered to match the progression of this set. I guess I've made so many maps now that some of them have their own mysteries!

===================

Map:		15
Name:		Spaceport
Difficulty:	Medium-Hard
Music:		In Flames - Reroute to Remain

Story:		Creeping along the vents, you can see you've made it to the starport at last. Now to commandeer a ship from the automated systems running them and the Demons that fill this area.

Notes:		Unsurprisingly, MAP15 in a Doom II megaWAD hides the secret exit to MAP31! If you don't find it, there's a damage exit waiting for you, just like at the end of Phobos Anomaly in the original Doom. This map is reasonably big, and difficulty gets a bit spiky at points, but as you're halfway through, you should be well in your stride by now! This was one of the earlier maps made for the set, as it's a "key" one. It also took some serious fixing to stop soft-locks, but I think I've done it now!

===================

Map:		31
Name:		Holiday
Difficulty:	Medium
Music:		Kool and the Gang - Celebration

Story:		You've commandeered a ship and opted to take a bit of a break. Fighting demons is hard work, so you deserve it, right?

Notes:		Again, I won't shock anybody by revealing this map also has a secret exit. The quest to get your luggage and leave the demon-infested resort is a bit tongue-in-cheek, but the map is pretty fun, if you ask me! I actually based the night-time beach scene on "Club Paradise" in Palawan, which is in the Philippines. Very nice place! Also, this map gives a couple of great rewards to continuous players.

===================

Map:		32
Name:		The Waiting Room
Difficulty:	Hard
Music:		Metallica - The Wait

Story:		Extending your break meant you missed your flight out. Unfortunately the airport is about to see a surge in waiting passengers for the next flight... Still, Duty Free opens soon...

Notes:		The cliche of the super secret map being harder than most of the rest of the set is a time-honoured tradition. At least if you last through this you get a shot at an incredibly helpful secret (if you're playing continuous). Also, if you want a cool feature (and get a moment to), look out of a window at the growing shadow of the arriving spaceship on the runway outside.

===================

Map:		16
Name:		Unruly Cargo
Difficulty:	Medium
Music:		Jefferson Starship - We Built This City

Story:		You got your ship (one way or the other) and have ended up in the cargo hold. Time to break out and take control!

Notes:		I'm not sure why I got so into detailing this map - the set was meant to be quickly built at one point. It ended up being another contender for favourite, though, and also made it into the 6-map demo! Plenty of "doom cute" here, but you'll need to manage your health. This was another "key map" built early on, after the final 11 had been made.

===================

Map:		17
Name:		Entrance Made
Difficulty:	Medium-Hard
Music:		AC/DC - Thunderstruck

Story:		Well... You brought down your own ship. You're nearer the nexus of both the industrial sector and the demon activity though, so you'll just have to push on, on foot.

Notes:		This was the second-to-last map made for the set, so I had a few linedef features that needed using up in fun, creative ways! Shout out to reflex17 on The Hellforge Discord for suggesting a good use for the silent crusher line action to make an unpredictable door here. I thought I'd try something a bit different for game play and eschew incidental combat in favour of a few large set pieces and some small ambushes. On Ultra-Violence, the first fight might be one of the hardest fights in the entire map set - hence the raised difficulty level - sometimes I seem to float through it like it's not difficult, other times I'm hopelessly pulverised. You've been warned, I suppose!

===================

Map:		18
Name:		Meat Grinder
Difficulty:	Hard
Music:		Fear Factory - Demanufacture

Story:		This highly mechanised area has been running on autopilot for so long that it may never be stopped - certainly not by you getting in the way of any heavy mechanisms!

Notes:		The final map made for the project! Something of a maze of meat and metal, I wanted a nice, open, non-linear main space for the player to explore, filled with incidental combat to make a nice contrast with the previous map. It kind of turned into my baby, and I spent way longer on it than I wanted to, but I guess it needed to be a big finale for my mapping experience on this project... Even if I did immediately do a load of tweaks to MAP19 afterwards. This map is a bit harder than originally intended, but your experience will vary massively, depending on the route you take.

===================

Map:		19
Name:		Fester
Difficulty:	Medium
Music:		Three Days Grace - (I Hate) Everything About You

Story:		This dark, decrepit little hole probably had something to do with sewage once - best not to hang around.

Notes:		The final map ported over from Triacontathlon. This was originally MAP28 for that project, and was brutal, whilst also being a three-hour speed map... Or possibly a 50-monster map, I'm not sure. I've toned it down significantly, and altered the ending to better link up with what's coming next. I'd played Blood - Fresh Supply before making this, so the secrets link back to previous areas whilst giving handy supplies, opening up the map significantly.

===================

Map:		20
Name:		Reclamation
Difficulty:	Medium-Hard
Music:		In Flames - Dead Eternity

Story:		This tiered recycling facility is your last stepping-stone to the heart of the area - you have to get through!

Notes:		I built this map to showcase the glorious sky (by Mechadon, in his Box o' Skies) one last time, hence the big vertical reveal at the start and elevated ending position. Plenty of moving parts this time around, particularly in the middle. Try not to think about why the floor of the platform keeps changing too much... This map was the fifth in the 6-map demo.

===================

Map:		21
Name:		Security Station
Difficulty:	Medium-Hard
Music:		In Flames - Bullet Ride

Story:		A security checkpoint and industrial facility walled off from both the outer areas you've just been through and the central core of the UAC industrial complex. You'll have to get your credentials in order...

Notes:		Circles. This map is made of them. It's also one of the larger maps in the set, and builds up in difficulty from "risk of attrition" to "genuine threat", but supplies are plentiful, albeit optional. 

===================

Map:		22
Name:		Power Trip
Difficulty:	Medium-Hard
Music:		Chimaira - Power Trip

Story:		You're finally into the central core, and immediately get your hands on a plasma rifle (at last?). Time to let loose.

Notes:		This map is pretty silly, but a lot of fun if you play in the intended spirit. You'll be mowing through hapless opposition, but run a high risk of attrition catching up with you if you're not careful. There's a big blowout at the end of the map, but only because it seemed fitting. It's a toss-up between this and MAP32 as to which veers more into "Slaughter" turf, but that's not my forte or preference.

===================

Map:		23
Name:		Corporate Hell
Difficulty:	Medium-Hard
Music:		In Flames - Trigger

Story:		The UAC corporate structure is corrupt, twisted and evil. It's also now full of demons that are between you and the Icon of Sin tower they've been building.

Notes:		The final map in the 6-map demo, this is the first in a series of short, tricky corrupt tech base maps that are more about being mean than swamping you with loads of enemies. This map also uses a lot of lighting effects.

===================

Map:		24
Name:		The Front Line
Difficulty:	Medium-Hard
Music:		Mastodon - Blood and Thunder

Story:		The green spaces here were presumably to help keep the low-level staff feeling keen and cared for. The demons kind of counter that sensation for you, but that can be fixed on your way up the corporate chain.

Notes:		Something a bit different from the rest of the episode, this map nonetheless carries on being tricky and mean.

===================

Map:		25
Name:		Middle Management
Difficulty:	Hard
Music:		Led Zeppelin - Immigrant Song

Story:		It's a dog-eat-dog world at this level, vying for promotion to the upper echelons. Of course, demons don't care what your reports looked like, so the concentrated malicious activity in this area is now more straight-forward in nature.

Notes:		Some difficulty spikes here, although it's a small map late in the set, so you're ready to work towards the end now, right? I've made some unusual use of line actions to help get a good start on the checklist I was working through here (did you know there's 139 different line actions in the 1.9 version of Doom and Doom II? Even though the numbers go up to 141?) so progression should be interesting.

===================

Map:		26
Name:		Upper Management
Difficulty:	Medium
Music:		Three Days Grace - Wake Up

Story:		The corridors of power aren't as impressive as you'd hoped, but from here you can get at the more sensitive stuff the UAC hid away from determined prying eyes.

Notes:		A smaller map that serves as a bit of a breather before the final run, although it's still capable of killing the unwary. There's a difficulty-based filter in place, made using Things, that changes the threat of a crusher in this level, which I thought was pretty clever, even if nobody will replay this map enough to notice! Despite initial appearances, the secret isn't one-time-only (in this latest version)

===================

Map:		27
Name:		Press Gang
Difficulty:	Medium-Hard
Music:		KISS - I Was Made For Loving You

Story:		This mechanised section seems designed to be dangerous. It sounds like there's a moshpit from hell trying to break out of the central room...

Notes:		I had a lot of fun making this map. Any player too slow to press a switch when they see why is in for a world of pain! Still, work through and you'll have an enjoyable revenge. If you get this right, the map isn't actually that hard, but you only need to let some of the middle room out for things to become very difficult, very quickly. To make the central mechanism work in complevel2, things aren't anywhere near as elegant as I'd like them to be, but it seems reasonably reliable now, so I'll take what I can.

===================

Map:		28
Name:		Broundry 3
Difficulty:	Hard
Music:		In Flames - System

Story:		Molten metal is in the air, as the demons engage in heavy industry to help build the tower. You're getting close!

Notes:		The big-brother, hard sequel to my two small Broundry speed maps. I like the brown foundry theme and think this map came out pretty well, although the difficulty here is maybe a little high for my preferences.

===================

Map:		29
Name:		The Armoury
Difficulty:	Hard
Music:		AC/DC - Big Gun

Story:		Last stop before the tower. Let's see if there's anything useful to bring with you...

Notes:		The second map made for the project, it's not quite as hard as Broundry 3, but still tough enough. The main secret here is another great one for continuous players, although you'll have to work for it!

===================

Map:		30
Name:		Final Test
Difficulty:	Very Hard
Music:		Judas Priest - Painkiller

Story:		It's you versus the tower now. If you topple this, then Hell should have no more Icons of Sin and will have lost a massive bastion of resources.

Notes:		I can beat this on Ultra-Violence, but it's a struggle. For those who are stuck at the end, shoot the walls behind the Spider Masterminds to access the final switch. You can use a step if you need to, as there's plenty of line-of-sight. This map was the first one I made explicitly for this project (started mid-2019) and was built in a burst of inspiration, followed by a struggle to make it compatible with the intended prboom+ complevel (2). Still, I made it! Hopefully you will too.
