Description             : Estranged is a 32 level megawad that uses stock Doom & Doom2 textures, I would describe the levels as cleanly detailed with a variety of environments. Levels are playable from pistol start.

			Story: You are a marine stationed on a UAC mining facility on a desolate world on the edge of the known galaxy. Whilst performing routine operations you lose communication with the main base, upon your return you find that demons have overrun the facilities. You send a distress signal but are faced with little choice but to venture inside and do battle with the hellspawn.
