Description		: Ten level episode for the game engine,
			  ZDOOM. This episode fully accomodates 
			  ZDoom's enhancements of free-look, jumping
			  and the Boom/ZDoom enhanced set of line
			  specials. It also has areas of complexity
			  and grandeur of archetecture and settings
			  not previously possible under DoomII. 
			  EarthZD also has a custom sky specifically 
			  designed for ZDoom. It is based upon the 
			  Earth.wad episode for DoomII by the same 
			  author.

	Story Line	: You arrive home in Earth's planetary 
			  system exhausted from enduring vicious 
			  combat that started on Phobos and led to the
			  Gates of Hell. You are on your way to sun,
			  surf, and fishing for a spell of well 
			  earned vacation. However, upon arrival in
			  low Earth orbit, you learn the terrible 
			  truth--Earth is not free. You study your
			  options and decide to insert upon a remote
			  and rocky coastline.
			Levels:
			  The Ruins (MAP01): You stand at your point
				of arrival, facing out to sea with 
				rolling breakers splasing on the rocks. 
				This looks like it should have been 
				your vacation site. But behind you
				are the ruins of civilization,
				haunted with alien hellspawn...
			  The Tomb (MAP02): To have hope of 
				freeing the world, you must take
				back the one place the enemy
				considers special. It is located 
				under the great pyramid...
			  Mines of Moria (MAP03): Like its
				Lord of the Rings namesake, it
				is crawling with evil things...
			  The Chasm (MAP04): The enemy is 
				bivouacked in rugged coastal 
				terrain. You mission is to clear 
				them out...
			  Strategic Defense Command (MAP05): A 
				deep underground command and
				control center, one of the last 
				great hopes for mankind in 
				repelling the alien invasion. 
				However, it seems to be off line,
				You need to find out why...
			  Observation Station (MAP06): This place
				has seen some action before it
				fell to the enemy. Beware!...
			  The Emerald Tower (MAP07): The Enemy
				has established a command post in
				a giant ornate emerald green tower.
				Your mission is to disrupt their
				communications by taking it back...
			  Ammo Pit (MAP08): This is the domain of
				the arch-vile. Trick him
				into helping you...
			  Islands (MAP09): You arrive on an rocky
				island in a rugged fjord. Out to
				sea and somewhat up the coast is
				another, larger island that you
				must somehow reach...
			  The Hill (MAP10): You must capture a 
				heavily defended fortress on a hill...

	Combat		: These levels contain a wide variety of
			  combat situations requiring different 
			  strategies. To win these levels,
			  especially at the more difficult skill
			  settings, requires thinking in terms of
			  fields of fire, planning your cover, 
			  looking out for your flanks and 
			  backside, and keeping open  your lines
			  of retreat. Most of the monster
			  placement is randomized so that their
			  location and response are different each
			  time these levels are played. Hence, you
			  will be unable to count on finding
			  specific monsters at specific locations.
			  (And there will not be many opportunities
			  for blasting monsters in their sleep.)
			  The monsters occasionally show sneaky
			  behavior due to features in the level
			  designs.
	Setting:	  This episode is set on a rocky coastline.
			  with spectacular outdoor views. These 
			  include high vistas and overlooks, live
			  surf crashing onto the rocks, scenic
			  elevator rides on the outside of tall 
			  buildings, spectacular bridges and a 
			  spectacular hilltop fortress new to 
			  EarthZD.
	General:	  Secrets generally have some clue that
			  the thoughtful and observant player can
			  spot. These levels are designed to be
			  winnable at the easier skill settings
			  without finding the secrets, but to win
			  the more difficult settings requires
			  locating most of the secrets.  There are
			  no totally hidden hazards or traps; 
			  there will always be some visual
			  or audio cue to warn of there presence.
			  Some of the pools and slime pits have
			  depth, ie, you will sink into them, 
			  sometimes up to your eyeballs.
			  Remember, though, this is ZDoom with 
			  free-look and jumping that plays more
			  like Quake than the original Doom.
			  Objects like trees, barrels, etc., are
			  not infinitely tall and the player can
			  jump up onto objects as tall as 56 units;
			  this will be an important factor in 
			  navigating some places and finding some
			  secrets. One final note; cliff edges at 
			  most of the high vistas are lethal to fall 
			  off of (one cannot expect to survive a fall
			  of several hundred feet in real life).

Directions for running	: EarthZD is a patch wad and is run with
			  ZDoom using an IWAD file. The IWAD file
			  can be DoomII, Plutonia, or TNT. Unzip
			  EarthZD.zip and place EarthZD.wad into
			  a directory of your choice. To start 
			  ZDoom (from the directory you have ZDoom 
			  in), enter on the command line of the
			  MS-DOS prompt something like:

   zdoom -iwad c:\doom2\doom2.wad -width 800 -height 600 -file <path>earthzd.wad

			  If you run this with Plutonia or TNT,
			  the -iwad part of the command would be 
			  appropriately modified with the iwad's
			  filename and path. The <path> in the -file 
			  parameter is the location where you placed 
			  EarthZD.wad. The -width and -height 
			  parameters set your screen resolution.
			  In the example given, the resolution is
			  800 x 600, which produces a relatively 
			  crisp level of detail. On a Pentium 200 
			  MHz MMX CPU, this produced a satisfactory 
			  frame rate. Newer, faster CPUs may use
			  even higher resolutions. On a 133 MHz 
			  Pentium, 640 x 400 is recommended. Older
			  machines should use the standard Doom 
			  320 x 200. Note on delays in loading:
			  wads with tall sky textures sometimes
			  require extra time for loading. If 
			  the startup screen for ZDoom appears to 
			  lock up, give it at least 30 seconds for
			  the loading process to complete.
