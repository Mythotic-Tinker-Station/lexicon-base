=Level Info=

MAP01 - Stratos One
Music: Turbo Tunnel [Battletoads]
Inspiration: Master Levels For Doom II

I wanted to make a level that cuts straight into the action, without giving the player too much of what is
needed; but just enough to be able to handle it. It was sort of inspired by how The Master Levels cut into
the action immediately with attack.wad.

MAP02 - Silence Of The Lambs
Music: Watch Your Step [Doom 64]
Inspiration: Based on a dream

The idea of this level is the supsension of encounter with the enemies. The level starts off being exposed
to the mancubi enemy and having to act quickly by grabbing the super shotgun provided and being careful
enough not to fall in the gap in front of you. You have to be aware of the environment and look out for
areas to take cover. Originally in the dream, this was a Doom 64 level (with a weird sort of blue mist in
all that metal darkness).

MAP03 - Fortress Command
Music: Stage 3 [Cybernator]
Inspiration: Based on a dream

Map 3 is a large fortress area with lots of exploration. I wanted to create a lot of connecting areas to
make for a fun and interesting experience in exploring the outdoor areas as well as the fortress itself.

MAP04 - Locked And Loaded
Music: Kitchen Ace (And Taking Names) [The Ultimate Doom]
Inspiration: Doom II in general

Originally called "The Great Outdoors" for all the outdoor activity; but I later replaced them with all
those metal areas and I had to change the name. Lame title, I know, couldn't think of anything for this
one.

MAP05 - Echoes
Music: Needle Man's Stage [Mega Man III]
Inspiration: Doom II

This was probably my first favorite level I made for this whole megawad. This one also endured multiple
changes to keep it up with the other, newer levels I was making at the time. Though it may/may not look
pretty from automap view, I love how those tunnels came out.

MAP06 - Kingdom Come
Music: Death's Bells [Final Doom: TNT: Evilution]
Inspiration: Ideas. :P

A big walled-in sky fortress with four seperate areas to explore. Not a very long level despite its size,
and if you're willing to explore, you'll find there's plenty of items to be found outside the fortress
walls.

MAP07 - Maximum Carnage
Music: Waltz of the Demons [The Ultimate Doom]
Inspiration: Final Doom

I am usually very glad to replace older levels that are no longer on par with any of the newer levels; no
matter how much I may try to update them/change them. This was probably the best map replacement I made.
It's a tough little one, sure, but it really adds to the new set of levels after the text screen inter-
mission.

MAP08 - The Flood
Music: Oww!!! [Rise of the Triad]
Inspiration: Based on a dream

I'm a little unsure about the inspiration for this level (besides the dream). I almost feel this was just
a little bit influenced by The Sewers and possibly the Enigma episode. Anyway, it's another level that
involves finding radiation suits in order to continue exploring the map.

MAP09 - The Foxtrot
Music: Surf City [Battletoads]
Inspiration: Master Levels For Doom II (The Catwalk)

Like The Catwalk, I wanted to try my hand on a rectangular-structured stage that involved the player first
exploring both sides of the map before finishing up by going up the middle section.

MAP10 - Artillery Base
Music: Track 1 (Metal Remix) [Top Gear]
Inspiration: Doom II (Refueling Base)

Like Refueling Base, I tried to make a base area with lots of connecting areas as well as making unique
areas all throughout the map. The goal of this level is to find the three keys, find the three switches
for the keys, and typically find the exit and be careful.

MAP11 - The Cyberstation
Music: Karnath's Lair [Battletoads]
Inspiration: Based on a dream

Based on a harsh dream that played around with the idea of Cyberdemon placement. There are about 7 Cyber
demons on the Ultra-Violence difficulty and most of them are placed where they are to caution the player
to watch and be careful of where they choose to go. There are also quite a few traps to look out for so
be sure to be on your guard when playing this level.

MAP12 - The Old Abandoned Mill
Music: Blizzardman's Stage (Heavy Metal Remix [Mega Man VI]
Inspiration: Doom II (The Factory)/Based on a dream

I wasn't sure I wanted to make a level inspired by The Factory because I wanted most of these
levels to be my own original work. But I couldn't ignore the fact that a dream I had sometime
earlier seemed to be strongly inspired by this level and as it turns out I'm glad I decided
to go along with this one. :) Have fun with those monster crowds.

MAP13 - Subterranean Suburbs
Music: Demons on the Prey [The Ultimate Doom]
Inspiration: Visions

I had this vision of a level that had buildings underground - and for each key you find in each area, you
would unlock a higher floor with more buildings. So I thought it sounded fun enough to try my hand on it
and try to make this a reality. It was originally called "Alpha Interior" because I wasn't sure at the
time what to call this level - much later I thought of Doom II's "Suburbs" and it gave me the idea for
this title.

MAP14 - Magnum Opus
Music: Adiago for Strings (G Minor) [Rise of the Triad]
Inspiration: Final Doom/Somwhat Jim Flynn

I'll be honest, I don't know why I called this "Magnum Opus" as I wouldn't exactly consider this my great-
est acheivement. And that's not to diminish the quality behind this level; I do believe I did a great job
on this one (I was a little low on ideas for titles though). Anyway, the inspiration itself is also just a
little unsure; though I think the passcode puzzle was probably inspired by one of Jim Flynn's levels.

MAP15 - Toxic Wastelands
Music: Intermission from DOOM [The Ultimate Doom]
Inspiration: Master Levels For Doom II (Bloodsea Keep)

This was one of several levels made within one day. Just a minature wood level hovering over a sea of
toxic waste.

MAP16 - Fistful Of Lead
Music: I Sawed The Demons [The Ultimate Doom]
Inspiration: visions/city levels in general

I sketched this one up before making it, I find it's a very useful way to make maps. :) This is also one
of my favorites; I love the atmosphere given by the sky texture used here. Kind of reminds me of SSBB for
some odd reason. Thanks to David J. Finnamore for the sky texture.

MAP17 - Spire Of A Dove
Music: Adrian's Asleep [Doom II]
Inspiration: visions

I think this was one of my more original levels. I wanted so badly to use blue marble textures throughout
this level I had to use my sister's computer just to email myself the marble textures and change the color
hue on photoshop. My computer wouldn't let me install photoshop at the time for some reason...

MAP18 - Fueling Docks
Music: Hiding The Secrets [The Ultimate Doom]
Inspiration: visions

I'm very proud of how this came out. This is probably the one level I made that reminds me constantly that
I am capable of making fun levels, too. I'd say this map encouraged me to keep going when I felt my levels
weren't up there with all the super-detailed levels of today. But then I realized that's not the point,
I never intended this megawad to be in league with those giants; it's simply a fun, old school styled mega
wad for those who (like me) sometimes feel the need to play something out of nostalgic value. So do try
and appreciate this one.

MAP19 - Mountain Stronghold
Music: Volkmire's Inferno [Battletoads]
Inspiration: Um...Jim Flynn!

I had designer's block throughout the making of this level. What kept happening is I would make some areas
then ask myself, "How should I fill this gap?" which often left me wandering endlessly in my ideas. Well,
now that that's over with, I can look back at yet another level that makes me feel capable of accomplish-
ing something great in the making of Doom WADs.

MAP20 - Core Babylon
Music: Last Boss (Heavy Metal Remix) [Mega Man VI]
Inspiration: visions, I guess?

I had the idea all along to make three levels connect with each other as if it were one big level. Well,
that ended up changing into two levels (Mountain Stronghold and this one) that connect with one another
to make one big level. I was originally going to make a town level (map18) , then have it lead up to the
main stronghold (map19) then have it lead into the second floor of the stronghold (map20). Instead, I went
with the MAP18 I have now and made maps 19 and 20 focus on the stronghold itself. The other cool idea for
this level is the cyberdemon that pops up on the bridge. You can either choose to fight it yourself or
simply continue the level without bothering the beast. Both have their benefits: when defeated you won't
have to worry about flying rockets across the bridge. When left alone the cyberdemon will help you fight
the last battle in the end room.

MAP21 - Remembered Fear
Music: Suspense [The Ultimate Doom]
Inspiration: TNT: Evilution (Storage Facility & Caribbean)

Both influences are obvious and present. This is another map that ended up replacing the old MAP21; and
I'd say I'm happy with the end result. Keep an eye out for those secrets; you never know where they are
(unless you open up the editor...drat!).

MAP22 - Gehenna
Music: Bye Bye American Pie [Doom II]
Inspiration: Doom II (The Living End)

Like any other level with this recurring theme (Perfect Hatred, Anti-Christ, Diehard, etc.) it's an over-
hanging level with plenty of harmful floors. Let's just say it's another tough level (maybe) with lots of
cacodemons to blast away. I'd like to try and make a level like this again sometime; I'm sure I could do
better...

MAP23 - Nexus
Music: He1M9 [Heretic]
Inspiration: Slaughter maps (probably Showdown from Memento Mori)

Big violent plus-sign of a level. :P

MAP24 - Beyond The Firestorm
Music: Horizon [Final Doom: TNT: Evilution]
Inspiration: Final Doom (Bunker) Requiem (Hatred)

I must have sketched this level out several times before turning it into something completely different.
I mostly wanted to make a level that was sort of like Bunker from Final Doom, but this one grew into
whatever it wanted to be (as well as having a bit of Requiem's influence).

MAP25 - Incubator
Music: Wily Stage 2 [Mega Man 8]
Inspiration: Memento Mori MAP25: Cesspool

This is one of a few maps original to the Doom Core Trilogy - part of my goal with the updates was to
replace the maps I always sort of dreaded reaching on a regular playthrough - that included the filler
maps of MAP25-27, as they were originally rejects from Reverie's early days I decided to use for the
last slots of Doom Core. I decided to go for a techbase theme since I didn't make enough of these back
then.

MAP26 - Cages Apart
Music: Cellar [Super Castlevania IV]
Inspiration: PSX Doom

Another replaced map for the trilogy release - this is an idea I've had for a while it seems - the map
titled Cages Apart sat among many other map titles I've come up with over time which remind me of certain
ideas that I've never tackled, so I decided to do that here with a new map after the last one.

MAP27 - Walkway
Music: Untitled [The Ultimate Doom]
Inspiration: visions

This is an old Doom Core map that was only rejected on the basis of being difficult to properly transfer
into a vanilla-friendly environment, what with the many open areas that either triggered the HOM or visplane
limits. It's here now to replace the last of the few filler maps in its rightful place - although it was
originally MAP28.

MAP28 - Unknown
Music: Demons On The Prey [The Ultimate Doom]
Inspiration: Memento Mori

Just a speedmap to replace the original MAP28 Walkway at the time since that one was hard to make Vanilla-
Compatible.

MAP29 - The Gutterway
Music: The Sewers by Stewboy
Inspiration: Final Doom (The Sewers)

One of Plutonia Revisited's rejected maps, with obvious inspiration.

MAP30 - Frontiers
Music: Final Battle Against Sigma - "For The Last Time" [Mega Man X5]
Inspiration: Based on a dream

The dream was pretty much as you play it. Except I added that Icon of Sin area for hard mode.

MAP31 - Dreamscape
Music: Legions of the Lost [Final Doom: TNT: Evilution]
Inspiration: Doom II (Entryway/The Inmost Dens)

I LOVE how this came out; another favorite of mine. The idea is to give a little of that Doom II Entryway
style (and a little of that Inmost Dens influence, too) to make for a more nostalgic experience. It also
has a little history in a couple of the areas and you'll be delighted to see the references made here and
there. This one's also tricky on the secret side, so you'd better have a "Super Metroid" mindset to work
this one through.

MAP32 - Like A Fist
Music: Intruder Excluder [Battletoads]
Inspiration: Based on a dream

Yet again, a harsh dream that drops you right in front of a cyberdemon. Take off running for the blue
teleport and arm yourself because this is going to be a bit of a challenge (mostly if you decide to play
this one from a pistol start).

MAP33: Stratos Gate
Music: "Let's Rock!" (PRIMEVAL)
Build Time: 3 hours

Entryway style obviously, I tried to avoid any sort of style imitations or remakes, but
this one sort of slipped through for lack of a better MAP01 start. The original MAP01
was going more for a Plutonia-style start up, of which was later removed and placed in
the MAP25 slot of Doom Core. So yes, I would probably be guilty for this one in terms of
style imitation (somewhat). I was going to sketch out MAP01 candidates in my sketchbook
one afternoon, this was the first map I sketched out to be an entryway style opener much
like TNT MAP01 (only much closer to entryway than I probably should have gone). I liked
the way it looked so much I decided to try and make it that night and it came out within
3 hours. There was a time I thought about replacing it, but after awhile I realize the
only reason I would have wanted to replace it was that people would suspect it was too
close to the entryway style. I agree, it probably is, but I like it enough to leave it
there as it is, as I've grown accustomed to it as the opening of Reverie.

MAP34: Soldier's Stand
Music: "Shut Up And Bleed" (PRIMEVAL)
Build Time: 2 days

I guess mostly Christen Klie comes to mind for this one, with some slight influences for
some interesting inter-connected areas. A little tech base level built into the side of
a mountain. Didn't take long to make, it was a nice little mapping session of mine.

MAP35: The Cup Of Wrath
Music: "Have A Frag On Me" (PRIMEVAL)
Build Time: 3 days

Structurally speaking, I was inspired by Cleimos 2 after viewing the maps numerous times
in XWE (without the grid). So I had seen the structure of this map in my head before I
ever had an idea of what it was actually going to look like. It's an interesting way to
improvise when approaching the territory of level design. Some might think it takes
inspiration from MAP03 of Doom II 'The Gantlet' due to the use of starport and metal
textures, but this level really doesn't hold much inspiration from that level.

MAP36: Divine Judgement
Music: "Haunted Corridors" (PRIMEVAL)
Build Time: Unsure - around 5 or 6 days

Personally, I don't think I've studied Jens Nielsen's designs closely enough to put out
a map that could be confused for his creations, but the intent was at least to get a
different enough map that it would seem to have come from someone else. Which was
certainly a focus of mine when working on this megawad. If I was going to do it alone,
I was at least going to pretend I was multiple different authors making different maps
enough to give a good taste of variety. I can't say as to whether I've accomplished this
or not. I was between completing this and MAP20 at the time of working on this. I
remember being in a motel room in San Simeon viewing the two of them while the Sixth
Sense was playing on TV - good memories. :)

MAP37: Substance
Music: "DOOM Funk" (PRIMEVAL)
Build Time: A handful of hours, made within a day.

Orin Flaharty comes to mind, though slightly with few given techniques (overhanging
poles, some solid looking areas, the use of nook and crannies to house candles). Some
slight Jens Nielsen ideas were also tossed in for added measure (narrow staircase with
torches). The last room texture choice is a bit "Circle of Death" or maybe "Hell's
Kitchen" given the author influence. Though the author himself (Orin Flaharty) was John
Romero influenced - gives an odd hybrid of influence. A little bit of American McGee
influence as well, given the use of the BROWNHUG texture surrounding the grass flats.
It's an odd quirk but I like the old 90's vibe it gives.

MAP38: Sledgehammer
Music: "Ashes" (PRIMEVAL)
Build Time: 4-5 days

You may have noticed the full automap structure looks much like a sledgehammer itself.
This was done on purpose much like MAP03, as some maps weren't so much influenced in
category of texture choice or architecture, but sometimes automap structure inspiration
can call for some interesting results. It's a fun thing to experiment with, I really
just imagined a MAP06 slot would look something like the way it came out. It was also
originally more difficult, relying on some puzzles to figure out how to solve the level,
but I was rebuked by the playtesters to make it easier, so I did.

MAP39: Lazarus
Music: "Arachnobus Mayhem" (PRIMEVAL)
Build Time: A handful of hours

Another one made within a day, had the picture of this map in my head for awhile before
finally stepping up and mapping the whole thing out. It was so much fun in the early
days of Reverie's developement, as most of the maps at the time were made within a day.
Amazing times.

MAP40: Triplet II
Music: "Knee Deep in DOOM" (PRIMEVAL)
Build Time: A week or so

An unofficial sequel to Jim Flynn's episode replacement for Doom II: Enigma. Even though
it was actually 9 levels it is definitely one of my favorite episodes ever made for Doom
II (besides Dystopia 3). I am also a big fan of Jim Flynn's work, as he had a tendancy
of making epic-sized maps with incredible innovations and ideas that made you feel
overwhelmed in amazement. I tried to go for that here, not so much in the Jim Flynn
style, but with a mix of my own ideas. I'm sorry to say that I could not conquer the
savegame buffer of this level; you could always save it at the exit of MAP07 in any
vanilla doom port.

MAP41: Fracture
Music: "Death Waltz in B Minor" (PRIMEVAL)
Build Time: 2 days

Inspired by Sverre Kvernmo's Derelict Station (CABAL2.ZIP) A smallish base with plenty
of action to be had, while being somewhat fractured. The furious "ending" of this level
was also inspired by the constant traps that occurred at the end of CABAL6 (Eye of the
Storm) by Sverre Kvernmo. This was probably another one of those maps that I had doubts
about at first when I started woring on it, but sometimes you have to push your way
through those doubts and just make a fun level. I recall listening to King Crimson while
working on this level, I reckon the song "Fracture" gave me the idea for the title, as
it seemed fitting.

MAP42: The Tech Towers
Music: "Locked & Loaded" (PRIMEVAL)
Build Time: 5-6 days

Another Enigma-inspired map; with a hint of Memento Mori II (Corporate Hell). Hope you
guys don't get too lost in this one, as it can prove to frustrate some people not
knowing where to go; I recommend following that red arrow in the beginning, though
you're free to be as lost as you like in this monster, if that's your thing. I think
most of all I thought about that level in Enigma titled "The Tower" as that was also
somewhat of a beast to navigate, but I really love getting lost in all it's creation. I
wanted to make an epic-sized level slightly inspired from such an idea, as it consists
of many buildings to navigate, but with a little more direction on where to go thanks to
the dogging of the doomworld community. Note: I will never make a megawad for you dogs
again. "Good riddance!" you might say, well, I'm inclined to believe the same. :)

MAP43: Hello, Cybie!
Music: "Guns-ablaze" (PRIMEVAL)
Build Time: 2-3 days

Another map purposely structured to look odd yet creative. Definitely another of the
Christen Klie inspired maps, more specifically Subspace from The Master Levels, only
much more difficult. If you look at the automap structure of Subspace from the Master
Levels then you should be able to spot the influence it had on this map.

MAP44: Armageddon valley
Music: "Burning Times" (PRIMEVAL)
Build Time: Most likely a few days.

Just a little rocky earth level to get the next episode started up. A bit inspired from
The Waterway by Orin Flaharty, somewhat Cleimos 2 as well. There are some really tricky
secrets in this level so keep your eyes open.

MP45: Stronghold Earth
Music: "The Calling" (PRIMEVAL)
Build Time: 3-5 days

Another big map to be explored, with some rockies and some buildings. Inspiration comes
mostly from Fortress of Death by Andrew Harvey. I thought the exit idea was hilarious,
seeing the boat and paddles right there waiting for you. As if you were on some quick
getaway from hell and you're yelling to yourself, "ROW!!! ROW!!! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD,
ROW!!!"

MAP46: Tyranny
Music: "Legions of the Night" (PRIMEVAL)
Build Time: Probably 3 days

Another map built to look that way structurally on purpose. It's an interesting practice
to make with what you have according to the shapes of sectors and such. It makes the
maps look so pretty. Some Icarus inspirations, with Christen Klie (again) for some
interesting quirks. The idea in this one is sort of starting from scratch (outside the
fortress) then working your way through security (the bridge) then eventually usurping
the fortress itself. The arch-vile could be seen as the ruler of this place, sitting on
his throne the way he is. It feels good to feel like you're conquering enemy territory
and you've accomplished yet another mission along the way.

MAP47: Blade Runner
Music: "City Streets" (PRIMEVAL)
Build Time: Weeks

Another city map inspired from Industrial Zone, Corporate Hell and Karmacoma. Also
contains a homage to another of Christen Klie's creations (The Catwalk). If you're
extra tricky you'll find the secret exit, which isn't easy to find as it relies upon
secret searching in this level. This also suffers from savegame buffer, so be sure to
save at the exit of MAP14 if you're into that.

MAP48: Dark Zone
Music: "Dispersion" (James Paddock)
Build Time: A handful of hours

I made that first area at night then mapped the rest out the following day. I've had
this idea for the longest time and I'm glad to have finally mapped it out. It was a good
stretch for my mind to work out. That one area you teleport to with the highway street
and the street lights with a mountain view is inspired from a real place I used to visit
quite often. In Long Beach, there's this El Dorado Park area where people like to fly
their remote control airplanes. I used to bike ride there every afternoon (about 1 PM)
and watch them fly their planes. Sometimes I would ride there in the late evening of a
clear day, so you could see the mountains at sunset. This area I made looks somewhat
similar to such an area.

MAP49: Fatality
Music: "Fortress of Misery" (PRIMEVAL)
Build Time: 2-3 days

Took awhile to settle for some ideas surrounding the MAP17 slot. Some slight "The Five"
influence with the starting area, followed by some mixed styles of Orin and Jens yet
again, as they were both very creative. It was also slightly inspired by The Shaft from
Memento Mori II, having a series of miniature battle fields to take out before
continuing the actual level.

MAP50: Sleeping Spirits
Music: "Becoming" (PRIMEVAL)
Build Time: 4-5 days

Obviously this one draws from Blessed Are The Quick (Icarus) with some minor hints and
influences from The Mansion (PSX Doom). Had to try and make an animated rain texture,
of which ended up looking exactly like the one in Icarus (whoops!) Named Sleeping
Spirits because of the ghosts that wake upon gunfire. Keep an eye out for the television
set, you can turn it on/off via a remote control laying on the bed of a bedroom.

MAP51: Dusk Town
Music: "MDK" (James Paddock)
Build Time: Made within a day (mostly).

Somehow reminds me of Plutonia; I guess it's the earth feel that naturally lumps it in
the Plutonia category. Anyway, I started this map one morning but a car ride took the
whole day away from me, so the following day I picked up from where I was and completed
it. Can be quite a nasty map so watch out.

MAP52: One Such Reverie
Music: "Sludgeville" (stewboy)
Build Time: A long time!

I was constantly thrown away from this map, due to having to pursue other ideas I had
that had to be made (MAP01/MAP04 for example) but eventually I came back and completed
this map. I made the starting area and the following area in a handful of hours, but I
wasn't really sure where to take the map. So I felt making an interconnecting map with
teleporters would be a good way to go. Even though I already had that in mind for
something else entirely (see Triplet II).

MAP53: Sunrise
Music: "Darkness Calls" (James Paddock)
Build Time: Probably 2 hours.

A smallish map intended for survival. Made within a movie's length (Princess Mononoke -
on a random trivial note). It used to be strictly that first arena you teleport to but
I'm glad to have expanded it the way I did over time.

MAP54: Egyptian Plains
Music: "Aztec Gods" (James Paddock)
Build Time: 2-3 days

Another Cleimos 2-inspired map, using those CLEGYPTA-D textures. I do like how it turned
out, though ironically I really like how that sewer area turned out. Someone thought it
was Epic 2 inspired but it actually isn't as I hadn't played that megawad until long
after I had completed this level.

MAP55: Cyclone Rider
Music: "Relics" (James Paddock)
Build Time: 4-6 days

Had to make that first area as I was inspired by the design of MAP26 of Memento Mori
(Between Scattered Corpses). It had four spider masterminds and a cyberdemon at the
begging and yet it managed not to be too overwhelming. Following this is the level
itself, which puts the good old Doom 64 textures to use, with some further style mixing
structurally speaking. I used some of the Doom 64 textures because the most I can do
with texturing is either remixing existing stock Doom II textures or just taking a
picture of something outside and making that a texture. I felt there was sort of a lack
of new textures, in other words, that I thought Doom 64's textures would be interesting
and fun to use for such an occasion.

MAP56: Sewer System (Arch Vile's Den)
Music: "Fallen Sun" (James Paddock)
Build Time: 3-4 days

I think MAP24, 25 & 26 were the toughest to come up with. They were just three empty
slots that needed to be filled to complete this megawad, and I wasn't about to stop.
After a long while, I finally stepped up to make a sewer-themed level. Not much
background surrounds it other than the idea that it would originally be populated by
arch-viles (hence the subtitle "Arch Vile's Den").

MAP57: Sever Tomorrow
Music: "Killing Spree" (PRIMEVAL)
Build Time: 2-3 days

I tried hard to find inspirations for these last three levels, even going as far as
searching up old N64 classics on YouTube. Originally, I had a couple ideas for this
map. It would either be inspired by the cruiser ship from Go For Broke (Bomberman 64)
or possibly Mizer's Palace (Jet Force Gemini). I ended up going with something else
completely; something that at first was inspired by Last Call from Final Doom, with a
mix of Super Mario 64 thrown in there (the western areas, mostly inspired from inside
the Pyramid of Super Mario 64). This is another map that can be difficult if you don't
take your time with the monsters of the map. This was also the very last map I made for
this megawad so you can imagine how excited I was to complete it.

MAP58: Fallen Angel
Music: "The Crypts" (PRIMEVAL)
Build Time: 2-3 days

Sort of a mix between the inspired structure of MAP25 of Cleimos 2 (Well of Fire) but
with the style of play for something like Not That Simple (Memento Mori). A smallish,
violent level without any worry of savegame buffers. Plenty of monsters to fight when
navigating to and fro certain areas of the map.

MAP59: Godspeed!
Music: "Bound For Glory" (PRIMEVAL, stewboy & James Paddock)
Build Time: 3-4 days

When I first got Plutonia Revisited I had to get a sneak peak of each level before
actually playing the megawad. When I reached MAP24 (Terra Incognita by 4mer) I knew
right away I was looking forward to playing that level, and I knew right away I wanted
to make a Living End style level that is as free-going as it looks. I've decided to
avoid the use of damaging floors surrounding the entire level as I would like to
encourage further exploration as well as breaking away from the age-old tradition of
Living End-type levels.

MAP60: Turbine Accelerator
Music: "Crimson Sky" (PRIMEVAL)
Build Time: 3 days

Inspired from the bigger Casali maps (Pharoah, Caribbean, The Sewers, Odyssey Of Noises)
only this is more of a metal-themed tech map. With an outdoor area and a waterway near
the end. This was one of the earliest map ideas I had for this megawad (of which would
originally have been a 3-level PWAD) along with MAP29 and MAP30. Reverie was based on a
reverie of sorts, with MAP29 & 30 following closely by.

MAP61: Salvation
Music: "Hell's Last Stand" (PRIMEVAL)
Build Time: Some hours

I really intended this level to be sort of an arena-type battle. This was actually based
on a dream I had, with MAP28 & 30 following as part of my vision for this project. It
really is amazing what you can do to make dreams come true. Also made within a day.

MAP62: Final Doom
Music: "After The Storm" (stewboy)
Build Time: 3 days

This last level incorporates everything I wanted Reverie to be; beautiful and action-
packed, with a slight hint of nostalgic goodness. There are plenty megawads out there
already that go for the hellish ending, with crazy blood caves and torture chambers. I
wanted Reverie to have a beautiful ending with an atmosphere of hope for survival. It
really puts a good feeling in your heart to know you've saved the world once again from
these hellish monsters. Even if it's just a dream, of which, realistically so, could be
associated with the idea of video games in general. We all like to feel like a hero from
time to time; this is just the way video games should be.

MAP63: Metal Mansion
Music: "Lost In Our Dreams" (PRIMEVAL)
Build Time: 4-5 days

Something inspired from Excalibur (Eternal Doom) because I was really attracted to the
idea of a puzzle map that relies upon secret searching. It gives the option to quit and
take the normal exit if you're too exhausted by the subtle hints of progression found
throughout the level. Otherwise, if you're extra clever, you'll discover all the secrets
in order to reach the super secret level.

MAP64: Deadlock
Music: "Stigmatism" (PRIMEVAL)
Build Time: 3-4 days

Just a smallish map that plays violently. Another of which takes inspiration from the
secret levels that were rather small in size (Requeim MAP32, Icarus MAP32, Cleimos 2
MAP32). I was tempted to replace this one at one point, since it seems there isn't too
much special about this super secret level, but I couldn't bring myself to remove a map
that I enjoyed. Hope you guys can manage well with this one.

MAP65: Mezzanine (or, "East Mezzanine Way")
Music: "Skedar Ruins" (Gold Jinjo) [Perfect Dark]
Re-Build Time: somewhere around 2-3 days...

One of three tune-up levels. This was actually the first map I ever made when introduced to mapping for Doom II.
It's actually based on my grandparent's house as well as a little influence from the surrounding neighborhood.
Updated to look MUCH more polished...

MAP66: Stratos HQ (or, "Stratos Headquarters")
Music: "Message of the Archvile" [Doom II]
Re-Build Time: 2 days I think.

The second personalized tune-up map of mine. This one was originally made maybe sometime in late 2009/early 2010, not
long after the first map was made (late October/early November 2009, I think). This one also underwent a major update,
and I must say this level has never looked better...

MAP67: Fortress (or, "Ancient Mining Technology")
Music: "Goldwood Tunnels" (Jay Reichard) [Jet Force Gemini]
Re-Build Time: 2 days

The last of the three super old maps I decided to tune-up for this episode. I was originally going to get as many old
levels as I could into this episode, but the other levels were killing my interest just as well as they were killing
me. I really felt the need to make brand-new levels instead of trying to save some really old maps I made. Although
I am glad to have gotten at least three old maps into this episode. Anyway, this was originally MAP03 of the super old
version of Doom Core, long before it was ever near 32 maps. It was somewhere around 9-10 maps before I started to re-
place a bunch of those outdated maps. Once again, I'm very pleased with the results of the update.

MAP68: Outpost Silence (or, "Outpost Of The Silent Gravestone")
Music: Mist ache" (Lee Jackson) [Rise Of The Triad]
Build Time: 2 days

It was kind of slow at first trying to find myself in this map, but things started to take off as soon as I reached
making that caged baron of hell area. I was mostly influenced by what I recall seeing and playing in Denis Moeller's
levels, more specifically his map The Inmost Dens II. I also remember I had that music for that level stuck in my head
so I'm sure that really drove my mapping up to speed through completing it.

MAP69: Meshing Core (or, "Beelzebub's Fungus Attic")
Music: "Funeral of Queen Mary" (Lee Jackson) [Rise Of The Triad]
Build Time: 2 days

This is actually a birthday map I made for Phobus. The mapping time for this map was phenomenal. Although I listed
2 days as the build time, the map was mostly made within a day. I only made that starting area one day and worked a
little bit with it, but the next day I suddenly took off and didn't stop until it was completed. I wish I could have
recorded myself with fraps or something because I couldn't believe I was making this map so fast. I don't mean to
sound as though I were boasting, it was one of those days where I started having all these good ideas and I couldn't
help but press on until it was finished. Anyway, that's what I remember the most when I think of this map. I do like
some of those inter-connected areas came out. It's one of those things where you look at this room that looks like
nothing exciting will happen, only to find after progressing a bit the room starts to take itself apart, with moving
floors and cielings and staircases and all that. I had a lot of fun making this map.

MAP70: Cacoplasm (or, "Amongst The Deadly Water Chasm")
Music: "Gresta" (Tom Mustaine) [Icarus: Alien Vanguard]
Build Time: 1 day

A short level, but quite open for destruction. Lots of fighting going on in big, open (cave) spaces. Certainly has its
inspiration from Icarus: Alien Vanguard MAP31 (Great Balls of Fire) cause I liked the openness of that map as well.
Also has plenty of secrets to search for.

MAP71: Woodheart (or, "Trail Of Twenty-Four Riddles")
Music: "Attack Ship - Covert Assault" (Iceplug) [Perfect Dark]
Build Time: 2 days

WARNING! This map is chock full of traps and surprises. You'd best navigate and search for some secrets, as there are
plenty in this map. Though of course the map is possible to beat without secrets (but it sure took me awhile, though!)
This map is quite challenging mostly because of the monster placement. Probably not for the faint of heart, so keep
steady and make choicy battle maneuvers, you're gonna need it. The level is obviously Jens Nielsen inspired, because
he was one of my favorite authors. It is possible to get trapped if that arch-vile enemy tries to resurrect the only
arachnotron enemy in the level. So yeah, try to avoid that. If it does happen, however, try to avoid killing him
again, at least until you are able to access the exit. Then you can terminate him from the platform so it won't matter
that it raises a second time (just don't fall down). Oh, and don't worry about what the switches do; a vast majority
of them pretty much have the same effect. There are 24 pillars blocking the exit, and as you progress the level, the
exit becomes a little more available. Hence the "Twenty-Four Riddles" part of the subtitle.

MAP72: Ion Station
Music: "Hiding The Secrets" (Robert Prince) [The Ultimate Doom]
Build Time: 3 days

Another birthday map, this time for DeathevocatioN. Worked on in the style of Andy Badorek as I recall DeathevocatioN
expressing his love for the non-linear style of his maps. I'll admit techbase maps are not the easiest for me to
design, but this one came along nicely. I ended up using another music track because someone somewhere always has a
problem with the music track...

MAP73: The Forsaken Town (or, "To Whom They Forsook")
Music: MAP06 of Perdition's Gate
Build Time: 2 days

A map with plenty of doom2.exe tricks including the 3d bridge, double 3d bridge, a swinging door, a room-over-room
effect, and other interesting tricks. I really love how that huge double 3D bridge area came out.

MAP74: Excursions
Music: MAP08 of Perdition's Gate
Built Time: 5 days

Lots of places to go, have fun.

MAP75: The Last Stand
Music: MAP31 of Perdition's Gate
Build Time: 2 days

The last area before the icon of sin area was actually based on a dream I had where I was working on an episode with
Thomas Van Der Velden, only he was actually Jan Van Der Veken (!?!?). I'm quite surprised it came out exactly as I
remembered seeing it in the dream. The last area was originally more bare, sort of focusing on the icon battle itself
rather than having a building to navigate. So I returned after a long while and I decided I wanted something a little
more fun to play around with, so I added that building structure with a rather difficult progression. Navigate outside
of the building to flip all the surrounding switches to give access to the icon's weak spot. It is also recommended
that if you plan to save it at any time in this level you should save it just before the teleporter to the last area.
Apparently the game might crash for an unknown reason if you try to load a saved file from the last area. Strange...

MAP76: Goodbye Again
Music: "Credits (2)" (Jarel Jones) [Mega Man X]
Build Time: like 2 minutes lol

Just a credits map - a silly one at that, and it's the end of the wad! Or is it?

MAP77: Terrace View
Music: "I Sawed The Demons" (Robert Prince) [The Ultimate Doom]
Build Time: a few days

Based on the second map I ever created, which never was finished. I wanted to somewhat recreate another old home
location in Lake Tahoe we used to live in - this time with focus on more Doomy designs and hordes of enemies flooding
the exterior areas. It's a nice little bonus to round out the trilogy experience and the real conclusion of the story.

==========================
*Wad description/History*

===DOOM CORE===

This is a new 32-level megawad made entirely from scratch. This is not an insanely detailed megawad
that took infinity hours to make, the maps are more on-par with the Doom II style (which I know most
of you hate) or at least designed to my own particular satisfaction. Anyway, this is what I *think* I
would have made had I been involved at the time. Many maps were either based on dreams I've had or were
simply ideas that came to me at the time of making this.

I started the mapping for this personal project sometime in late November 2009. Some of the earlier
maps I made were used for the first episode onward so there is some what of a progression of detail
as the levels go on (though the oldest map of the set is MAP02). Some of the original maps were re-
placed later on due to my dissatisfaction so some of them might jump back and forth. Anyway, I hope
you can at least enjoy some of this, after all, there's plenty of maps to try out. If not, well, you
can go play your precious "Alien Vendetta", "Speed of Doom" or whatever.

Anyway, with that aside:

THE STORY:

Doomguy goes hallucinating...Doom Core...

In order to break free from his hallucination, he must terminate himself (easy/normal) or destroy the real
mastermind behind the hallucination operation (hard).

If you do break free, however, you'll be rewarded with an eternal vacation in a world of your very own to
play around with...

That is until he went from hallucinating to having a daydream...


===REVERIE===

Reverie began as a side-project besides Doom Core, and it was to be a few maps or more in length. As I came
to understand vanilla mapping better over the previous months, I was able to focus myself better on achieving
what I felt to be a more cohesive experience, which led to me engaging it with even more maps and ideas. After
a while it was starting to turn into another megawad alongside Doom Core, which wasn't even finished yet. I
eventually returned to Doom Core in the following summer of 2011 and wrapped up what was left to be done before
releasing it in July 2011. Reverie was started in August 2010, and was later completed in the following August,
but wasn't quite ready for release due to the soundtrack being incomplete. It would later finish by November 2011
for a release two weeks in. It later won a cacoward that year in 2011.

-=The Story=-


After fighting your way through your demonic hallucinations the year before, you go for a ride in what seems like
an everyday activity of putting miles behind you to enjoy the cool breeze of the open world around you, but something
is wrong - a strange disturbance can be felt in the wind, and it sweeps underneath your vehicle - sending you outside
and into the unknown. Not much is remembered about the incident - the mystery of it envelops you in a haze of
confusion and wonder. You awake to find youself somewhere else entirely - a familiar starport can be spotted across
from you, with danger looming the horizon...

And thus the same unwanted threat makes haste to wreak havoc in your peaceful little world - now it's time you
threatened their time in silence and bring with you a greater force of violence.


===ETERNALLY YOURS===

The last of the Doom Core Trilogy - Eternally Yours sets itself apart as only containing an episode's length of maps
at 11 slots along with a credits map. It contains a few of my oldest maps updated to meet the par of my mapping quality
at the time and a couple of birthday maps I created - the rest were original ideas to round out what was intended to be
my original goodbye from the Doom community. As I appreciate the amount of experience that came with working on Doom
Core and Reverie, I still feel to this day that Eternally Yours was my most matured effort that I hold as one of my
best works.


-=The Story=-

First the demons tried to steal your mind, then they tried to steal your soul...now months later the threat of
invasion becomes a reality, as it's no longer an attack on your senses but an attack on the world at large. The
anti-christ arrives to put the earth in eternal turmoil and sufferings, and you've only got your loaded pistol
you keep safe at home on the off-chance you might need it against an armed robber. You've got a neighborhood
full of unwanted neighbors - undead soldiers, demons and other monstrosities - and now it's time to lay them all
to eternal unrest. Your goal is to eliminate the demon-spitter and lay low - realistically, this threat is too
much for a single human being, so it should be enough to annihilate the local hellspawn and take cover until
any further backup arrives.
