                          Bloody hell.
                          I hope you all enjoy playing!

Description             : Vile Flesh is a full 32 level replacement for
                          Doom2. You'll find the fist few levels are
                          perhaps more reminicent of the original Doom,
                          and as you progress, the levels
                          become larger, more complex and far more
                          challenging (think Eternal Doom).
                          I've done my best to implement difficulty 
                          settings, but they don't make a big difference
                          on later levels anyway. I hope you enjoy
                          playing Vile Flesh!
                          ==============================================

                          It had to happen sooner or later...
			  With the UAC in tatters and all off-world projects
                          on hold, the only functioning UAC base is on
                          Earth (though it's been kept well and truly
                          hidden from prying public eyes). It was only a
                          matter of time before something went wrong...
                           Using the UAC's supposedly dismantled 
                          interstellar gateway system, the demons of Hell
                          have brought more than the hoards of the undead
                          with them. This time they bring the very essence
                          of Hell itself.
                           And guess who's been called in to clean up the
                          mess.
                           Only a small portion of the original
                          architecture remains, making maps and floor plans
                          practically useless. But you're not fussed.
                           You never were one for technicalities.
                           Somewhere in the base is the open gateway, 
                          pouring the legions of the damned through into
                          our dimension. You must stop them before they 
                          turn the whole of the earth into their moribund
                          playground, before every last ounce of humanity
                          is ripped from the globe.
                           Lock and load, soldier...

Other files required    : vilefles.deh should be in the same .zip as the .wad file.


* Play Information *

Game                    : DOOM2
Map #                   : Map01 - Map32
Single Player           : Designed for
Cooperative 2-4 Player  : Player starts only (works fine, but possibly
			  not the best experience in the world)
Deathmatch 2-4 Player   : Player starts only (not extensively tested. I've
                          tried to keep the starts as close together as
                          possible, but some levels are just too big to
                          be enjoyable DM arenas. Levels after map 25 don't 
                          have DM starts at all. Note that maps 31 and 32 DO have
                          DM starts)
Difficulty Settings     : Yes


* Construction *

Build Time              : More than 2 years all in all (!) 
Editor(s) used          : Wad Author, WinTex and DeHackEd 3.1
Known Bugs              : Some texture errors when using the original Doom2 
                          engine. This is academic, though, because...
May Not Run With...     : The original DOOM2 engine. Although some levels
                          are fine, there are quite a few later ones that
                          cause visplane overflows.
                          Doomsday - Map 32 seems to cause Doomsday to crash every
                          time. It's also not possible to complete Map 27.
