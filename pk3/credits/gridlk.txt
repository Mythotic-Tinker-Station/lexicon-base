Description             : The basic idea was to restrict mappers from using
			  grid sizes smaller than 64 units. One, simple rule
			  which gave birth to the project and inspired the
			  contributors to explore different approaches to
			  level design, which encourages (but not limits them to)
			  bigger, simpler, but fun maps. The rule only applied
			  to vertices, so things might be off the grid but it's
			  not a problem.
