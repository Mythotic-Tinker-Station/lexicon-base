Description             : /\/\/\FILE UPDATED (Ver 1.1) 8/31/15/\/\/\
			  Here we worked on creating a 32 map megawad
                          consisting of efforts by those who are new to the
                          Doom mapping experience. The restrictions are as
                          follows: 
                          - All maps must be in limit removing format
                          (-complevel 2 if that definition means anything
                          to you)
                          - All maps are to be made entirely from stock
                          Doom II textures.
