Primary purpose         : Single player
Note (MegaDoomer)	: This version contains edits to significantly improve the gameplay in Map32, 			which was too good of a level in most ways to leave alone IMO.

Description             : classic doom megawad with 34 maps.
                          
                          I started this megawad in 2002! then I abandonned 
                          the project and reassumed it in 2011. back in 2002 
                          I made the following maps: 01-11, 21, 23, 26, 
                          70% 0f 24 and the drawing for 25. at that time 
                          my computer sucked and I used doome42 for editing, 
                          doomed42 is by far the crappiest doom editor ever, it's 
                          buggy as hell and too way primitive. it seems that 
                          my maps 24 and 25 could'nt be built with it because 
                          of its limitations, they crashed every time so I left 
                          the project due to dissapointment.
                          In 2010 I dove again in the world of doom and got 
                          doombuilder 2 so I made the rest of the levels 
                          and corrected some texture misalingments of the old 
                          levels. you may notice that the 2002 levels are 
                          smaller and simpler, more old schoolish than the 
                          new ones witch have more detailing and harder gameplay.
                          
                          The levels take the names of the buenos aires subway 
                          stations and most of them have a color predominancy 
                          of the respective station. there are 3 episodes: 
                          
                          line d (map01-11 and 31)
                          line c (map12-20)
                          line e (map21-30, 32 and 33)
                          
                          This was an idea just to give some cohesion to the wad,
                          some kind of pattern. 
                          however this wad contains just classic doom levels 
                          and not subways or anything like that. 
                          
                          This wad is strongly if not plainly themed on 
                          tech bases, i'd say that most of the levels have a 
                          shores of hell feeling but without the hell part, 
                          some others are more like tech doom2 levels (line c)
                          only levels 12 and 20 are more city themed. 
                          There are a bunch of hell levels on the net and 
                          those plenty of brown bricks and wood straight lined 
                          maps which I'll never enjoy so I tried to make a 
                          tribute to the classic techbase themed doom.
                           
                          Every level has been tested under 3 basic conditions:
                          1- pistol start
                          2- ultra violence
                          3- finished with 0% of the secrets

                          So there are'nt mandatory secrets and every level
                          is doable from pistol start though some of the can be 
                          a pain in the ass at the first part.
                          nevertheless this wad was built to be played 
                          consecutively

                          One tip: try not to let monsters behind you, I've put 
                          teleporting lines on some concave sections of some 
                          level in order to prevent monster stucking, 
                          so they'll follow you!!!
